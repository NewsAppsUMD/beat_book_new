    "content": "The St.\u202fMichaels Volunteer Fire Department (SMVFD) placed its new Engine\u202f45, a 2023 E\u2011One Cyclone, into service on July\u202f27, 2023. The engine tanker, equipped with a 1,035\u2011gallon water tank, Cummins L9 engine, Hale QMAX pump, Harrison hydraulic generator, Whelen and Firetech lighting, and an Arkon electric monitor, has already responded to calls, including pumping water for an attic fire in town the previous week. It carries 1,000\u202ffeet of 5\u2011inch supply hose, 500\u202ffeet of 3\u2011inch hose, five attack lines, a Blitzfire monitor, a battery\u2011powered fan, work lights and a full complement of firefighting tools, and replaces Engine\u202f49 as the \u201cfirst\u2011due\u201d apparatus after Engine\u202f48, a 1990 model that served for 33\u202fyears, was moved to reserve.\n\nFunding for the $718,850 apparatus came from multiple sources. \u201cIt\u2019s a combination of fundraising efforts and money that we get from the county, town and state,\u201d President Chris Thomas said. The department also issued a statement: \u201cThe department thanks the generous residents and businesses who helped make this purchase happen through their donations and support over the past few years.\u201d Thomas highlighted the community\u2019s role, noting that fundraising events such as barbecue chicken dinners, a fund drive, and \u201cpit beef and pit turkey offerings\u201d are popular, adding, \u201cI think that it is off the charts it\u2019s phenomenal.\u201d\n\nSMVFD, with roughly 70 members\u2014about half of whom are fire and EMS personnel\u2014faces the same staffing challenges as many fire agencies. Thomas explained that the town\u2019s retiree\u2011heavy demographics help staff the administrative side, but \u201cWe\u2019re hurting just like everyone else.\u201d Despite the manpower crunch and a three\u2011to\u2011five\u2011year lead time for new equipment, the department continues to plan for future acquisitions, including upgrades to its brush truck and tanker truck. Engine\u202f45 now sits in the right\u2011hand bay of the firehouse, ready to carry volunteers to the next call.",

    "author": "Molly O Brien; Herald & News",
    "content": "An Oregon man, Negasi\u202fZuberi, 29, has been indicted on interstate kidnapping and sexual\u2011assault charges after a woman escaped from a sound\u2011proof, cinder\u2011block cell built in the garage of the house he rented in the 1300 block of North\u202fEldorado Avenue, Klamath\u202fFalls. Police say the victim was \u201ckidnapped, chained (and) sexually assaulted\u201d and \u201ckidnapped, chained, sexually assaulted and locked in a cinderblock cell,\u201d according to a news release from the FBI\u2019s Portland field office. The complaint alleges Zuberi lured the woman, identified only as Adult Victim\u202f1, on the morning of July\u202f15 to engage in prostitution along Seattle\u2019s Aurora Avenue, then claimed to be an undercover officer, handcuffed and leg\u2011ironed her, and drove her 450\u202fmiles to his Oregon home where he assaulted her during the trip.\n\nAfter arriving, the victim was placed in the garage\u2011built cell with a metal door that could not be opened from the inside. \u201cOnce Zuberi left, the victim says she repeatedly banged on the door and was able to break the door open and escape the room,\u201d the release said. The victim recalled Zuberi telling her he was leaving \u201cto do paperwork.\u201d While trying to get out, she \u201crepeatedly punched the door with her own hands,\u201d Klamath\u202fFalls Police Capt.\u202fRob Reynolds told a news conference, adding that \u201cShe had several lacerations along her knuckles.\u201d She eventually broke enough of the welded joints to climb through, broke into Zuberi\u2019s vehicle, seized a handgun, and fled to the street, where she climbed over a wooden fence, flagged down a passing motorist, and was taken to Sky Lakes Medical Center.\n\nFBI Assistant Special Agent in Charge Stephanie\u202fShark said investigators have identified \u201cthree additional victims from other states where (Zuberi) has lived,\u201d and that \u201cThose states could include: California, Washington, Oregon, Colorado, Utah, Florida, New York, New Jersey, Alabama, and Nevada,\u201d according to an FBI statement. Evidence found at the residence included handwritten notes titled \u201cOperation Take Over\u201d and a sketch for an underground structure. \u201cHer quick thinking and will to survive may have saved other women from a similar nightmare,\u201d Shark said.\n\nKlamath\u202fFalls Mayor Carol\u202fWestfall, who and her husband Kevin owned the rental property, said there were no prior indications of Zuberi\u2019s criminal activity. \u201cWe had service people going there, and he would invite us in,\u201d Westfall said. \u201cIt was incredibly brazen.\u201d She added, \u201cHe came into this town, but it\u2019s over for him.\u201d Zuberi, also known as Sakima, Justin\u202fHyche, and Justin\u202fKouassi, has been charged \u201cwith interstate kidnapping and transporting an individual across state lines with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity,\u201d the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for Oregon said in a statement. After the escape, Zuberi and his family fled to Reno, Nevada, where Nevada State Patrol located them the next afternoon; Zuberi surrendered after a brief standoff. The child in the car was reported unharmed.",

    "content": "On July\u202f21, 2023, Baltimore City police, first responders and outreach workers cleared the homeless encampment on the corner of Dundalk and Holabird Avenues. A \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d notice posted earlier that month warned that \u201cthe area would be cleared on July\u202f21.\u201d The encampment, which had been occupied since earlier in the year with tents set up on a strip of grass in front of the Holabird Business\u202fPark, was cleared by noon that day.\n\nBaltimore City police issued a statement to the Old Dundalk Neighborhood Association saying, \u201cMembers of the Baltimore County Homeless Services Division have been working closely with Baltimore City officials to address the encampment near Dundalk and Holabird Avenues,\u201d and adding, \u201cWe understand how concerning it is to see this situation in your community. As the encampment is located on city property, the Baltimore City Mayor\u2019s Office of Homeless Services is leading response efforts in coordination with other City agencies, including the Baltimore City Police Department, Baltimore City Department of Public Works, and Baltimore City Department of Transportation with support from nonprofit organizations under contract with Baltimore County to provide outreach and access to services.\u201d The Mayor\u2019s Office of Homeless Services and nonprofit groups visited the site before the clearance to connect residents with shelter and drug\u2011treatment resources.\n\nCommunity groups\u2014including the Old Dundalk Neighborhood Association, Boston Courts, Norwood\u2011Holabird and Graceland Park\u2014had been lobbying for months. In February they wrote a letter to city and county officials requesting a solution, noting that long\u2011term tent living posed public\u2011health concerns and that police were regularly called to the site for crime and drug\u2011use incidents. Baltimore Police Precinct\u202f12 Capt. Glenn Wiedeck and City Police Maj. Kiera Saunders coordinated crime\u2011call responses, and ODNA President Jess Lilli observed, \u201cThey\u2019re actually speaking to each other right now and that didn\u2019t happen in the past,\u201d in April.\n\nThe Baltimore County Police Department, while not having jurisdiction over the city\u2011owned property, pledged to assist any displaced persons. The department said, \u201cThough this is a Baltimore City operation the Baltimore County Police Department is aware of the impact it may have on the surrounding county communities and is taking steps to offer any homeless person(s) services and resources if they attempt to migrate into Baltimore County,\u201d and added, \u201cOfficers will also be in place to remind any of these homeless person(s) that the camp sites they are used to in Baltimore City will not be allowed in Baltimore County.\u201d The operation concluded with Department of Public Works crews hauling away tents, belongings and trash, leaving the cleared site vacant.",

    "content": "For safety reasons, several common household appliances should never be plugged into a power strip. Hair\u2011dressing tools such as hairdryers, curling wands and flat irons require large amounts of amperage to generate heat, so they must be connected directly to a wall outlet\u2014ideally one equipped with a ground\u2011fault circuit interrupter breaker to protect against water exposure. Refrigerators and freezers also draw continuous current as they cycle on and off, which can quickly overload a power strip, so they need a dedicated wall outlet. Likewise, toasters and toaster ovens have exposed heating elements that require high current, making them unsuitable for extension cords or power strips.\n\nMicrowave ovens, which perform rapid cooking, thawing and reheating, demand more energy than a power strip can provide, and portable space heaters commonly use about 1,500 watts on their highest settings, creating a hazard if run from a strip for extended periods. All of these appliances should be plugged directly into wall outlets to avoid overloading power strips and to reduce the risk of electrical fires.",

    "content": "A line of strong storms moved through Maryland\u2019s Mid\u2011Shore region on Monday evening, dumping heavy rain and gusty winds. By 8\u202fa.m. Tuesday the National Weather Service recorded Cambridge\u2019s 24\u2011hour rainfall total at just over\u202f4\u202finches, St.\u202fMichaels at about\u202f2.7\u202finches, Easton at just over\u202f2\u202finches and Denton at roughly\u202f1.7\u202finches. Dorchester County Emergency Management Planner Jimmy\u202fWindsor said the 4\u202finches of rain fell in about two hours, quadrupling forecasts, and the downpours produced flooding that left motorists in the Henry\u202fStreet area wading through more than two\u202ffeet of water.\n\nThe storms also sparked a lightning\u2011induced fire on Maiden\u202fForest\u202fRoad near Vienna, which was quickly contained, and caused widespread damage reported by weather\u2011service storm logs, including damage to an Oxford restaurant and an \u201cabundance\u201d of downed trees and wires in Bozman and portions of Queen\u202fAnne\u2019s County. In Westminster, dozens of vehicles were trapped after power lines fell like dominoes onto a highway; utility crews turned off the electricity, allowing the 33 adults and 14 children in the cars to escape safely, Maryland State Police Superintendent Col.\u202fRoland\u202fButler said at a news conference Tuesday. A spokesperson for Maryland\u2019s largest power utility, BGE, called the destruction \u201ccatastrophic.\u201d Nick\u202fAlexopulos, speaking at a news conference Monday night, added, \u201cThis is damage that if you worked in electric distribution at BGE for your entire career, you may see it once.\u201d\n\nFirst responders and state officials praised the coordinated rescue effort. Gov.\u202fWes\u202fMoore said, \u201cThere were people who were stuck and stranded in cars who were able to sleep in their own beds last night.\u201d The storms disrupted air travel across the mid\u2011Atlantic, with FlightAware reporting more than\u202f2,600\u202fU.S. flights canceled and nearly\u202f7,900\u202fdelayed by Monday night, and the FAA warning of continued low clouds, winds and thunderstorms affecting airports nationwide on Tuesday.",

Deputies from the Talbot County Sheriff\u2019s Office responded to the University of Maryland Shore Medical Center at Easton around\u202f9\u202fp.m. when Cooper, who was driving, \u201cpassed Ray\u2019s vehicle, Ray shot at him multiple times, striking both him and his car.\u201d Cooper was able to drive himself to the emergency room for treatment. Ray fled the scene, failed to stop for a stop sign at Unionville Road and Bruffs Island Road, collided with several parked cars, disabled his own vehicle and then ran into nearby woods, prompting a 24\u2011hour manhunt that began early Monday.\n\nInvestigators learned Tuesday morning that Ray may have slipped through the search area during severe storms and headed toward the Washington,\u202fD.C., metro area. The Talbot County Sheriff\u2019s Office contacted the U.S. Marshals Capitol Area Regional Fugitive Task Force, which located Ray in northern Virginia that afternoon. At\u202f12:46\u202fp.m. on Tuesday, Alexandria police responded to a shooting at the Potomac Yard Shopping Center; officers discovered that the U.S. Marshals task force had found Ray and that \u201cRay was shot when the task force attempted to apprehend him,\u201d after which he was taken to a hospital with life\u2011threatening injuries. Detectives from the Alexandria Police Department are now investigating the shooting and are coordinating with the Talbot County Sheriff\u2019s Office. Ray, who is on probation for a 2009 attempted second\u2011degree murder conviction, now faces charges of attempted murder, first\u2011degree assault, reckless endangerment and use of a firearm in a violent crime or felony.\n\nTalbot County Sheriff Joe Gamble praised the multi\u2011agency effort, saying, \u201cI am incredibly grateful to the countless state, local and federal law enforcement officers on the Eastern Shore, CARTIF, and the Alexandria Police Department who willingly put themselves in harm\u2019s way to make our community safer during this manhunt.\u201d He added, \u201cDuring these strange times, as the Maryland Legislature continues to make policing more difficult, it is inspiring to know that there are still selfless men and women who are willing to risk their lives daily for all of us, knowing that their every action will be scrutinized by people who have risked nothing and have never known real danger.I can't thank these public servants enough for their sacrifice and heroism.\u201d",

The state\u2011of\u2011the\u2011art facility will sit on a 2.7\u2011acre property gifted by the town and will include a 3,500\u2011square\u2011foot concrete public\u2011safety building, a 3,600\u2011square\u2011foot classroom and storage building, and a 1,500\u2011square\u2011foot concrete pad for car\u2011fire, extrication, stabilization, and traffic\u2011safety training. It is intended to serve Easton\u2019s volunteer fire department, the six local volunteer fire departments in Talbot County, and fire departments across the Mid\u2011Shore, as well as law\u2011enforcement and EMS personnel. Talbot County has 260 active firefighters; the Easton Volunteer Fire Department responded to 896 calls involving 10,000 man\u2011hours and completed 1,910 hours of training in 2022.\n\n\"This state-of-the-art training campus will not only support EVFD members for their training but will also help us in recruiting and training new members for the department. The training campus will also enable us to support our partners in law enforcement and emergency services in their training and recruitment needs and to better coordinate our roles in emergencies.We encourage the community to support our fundraising efforts as we embark on this $5 million goal,\" said fire Capt. Daryl Caldwell.  \n\n\"It has never been more important than now to train our first responders and emergency personnel who serve Talbot County every day. There currently is no dedicated first responder training campus in Talbot County. The Friends of the EVFD and its volunteers accepted the challenge to raise $5 million for facility construction and operational expenses for the new campus.This campaign is essential toward ensuring cutting-edge training is available for all emergency services personnel,\" said campaign co\u2011chairman Brett Whitehead.  \n\n\"The sheriff's office is very excited to see this project come to fruition. The facility will not only offer training to our dedicated volunteer firefighters but will be able to support training for our deputies and police officers. Our citizens deserve the best-trained law enforcement officers. This training facility will support localized training to better equip our deputies while saving hard\u2011earned taxpayer funds through reduced travel time and associated expenses. The facility will also be available for K\u20119 training for tracking people as well as drug detection,\" Talbot County Sheriff Joe Gamble said.  \n\n\"We're very excited about the brand-new state-of-the-art training facility to be used by fire departments, EMTs, and law enforcement around the Mid\u2011Shore. This facility will allow us to train and recruit talented first responders from around the region. The Town is fully committed to helping our first responders safely and effectively serve our community, and this training facility is a crucial resource that will improve many facets of their operations. We are very thankful for the dedication and selfless service of the men and women who volunteer to protect and serve our Town, and thankful that they go above and beyond to ensure our community's safety,\" Easton Mayor Megan Cook said.  \n\nFor more information or to donate, contact campaign co\u2011chair Brett Whitehead at (302)\u202f236\u20116249 or whitenj20@gmail.com.",

    "content": "The St.\u202fMichaels Commissioners voted unanimously on Wednesday to revise police job descriptions and approve salary raises tied to a new organizational structure. The restructuring was prompted by the retirement of former Chief Anthony\u202fSmith on June\u202f30, after which newly appointed Chief Jeffrey\u202fOswald was sworn in the same day, leaving the captain\u2019s position vacant. Rather than recruit a new captain\u2014whose salary would have ranged from $85,000 to $100,000\u2014Chief Oswald recommended promoting two officers to sergeant and eliminating the captain role.\n\nUnder the old model the department consisted of a chief, a captain, two corporals and four patrol officers. The approved structure now includes the chief and two sergeants, each supervising two officers. A memo in the town\u2011meeting agenda noted that the sergeants will be able to cover each other\u2019s duties but will have distinct primary focuses: one will assist the chief with patrol responsibilities and the other with administrative tasks. The change will have a minimal budgetary impact, with the total base\u2011salary increase for the restructuring calculated at $7,200. The promoted sergeants will undergo mandatory first\u2011line administrator training, be recognized by the Police Training Commission to command in the chief\u2019s absence, and will serve a two\u2011year probationary period.\n\nThe St.\u202fMichaels Police Department is located at 100\u202fS.

    "content": "Police arrested Elon Black, 38, of Easton, and Lacira Wilson, 39, of Worton, for hindering a drug investigation that began on April\u202f4. Officers stopped Black\u2019s vehicle near U.S. Route\u202f50 and Cecil Drive, and a K\u20119 search discovered \u201csuspected heroin/fentanyl mix,\u201d crack cocaine and ecstasy, police wrote. During the stop Black was on his phone and called Wilson, who then placed a 911 call reporting a fake shooting at the Easton Walmart; officers who responded found no evidence of shots fired.\n\nBoth defendants were taken into custody on September\u202f18 and\u202f19 and charged with intent to distribute drugs, obstructing and hindering, and making false statements to police officers. Each posted a $10,000 unsecured personal bond, meaning the full amount is owed only if they miss a court date or violate other conditions.\n\nWilson\u2019s trial is set for November\u202f5 in Talbot County District Court, where she faces four counts: obstructing and hindering, making a false statement to officers, and two counts of possession with intent to distribute a controlled dangerous substance. Black\u2019s trial is scheduled for November\u202f3 in the same court on the identical four charges.\n\nIn a separate case in Talbot County Circuit Court, Black also faces two felony counts of possession with intent to distribute narcotics, six misdemeanors and 11 traffic violations stemming from the April\u202f4 traffic stop; a jury trial for those charges is slated for December\u202f8. He posted a $10,000 unsecured bond for the felony charges back in July.",

    "title": "Gallatin County Sheriff's Office welcomes public to tour new building at Four Corners",
    "date": "2024-12-18",
    "author": "Laurenz Busch Chronicle Staff Writer",
    "content": "Sheriff Dan\u202fSpringer hosted a public tour of the new Gallatin County Sheriff\u2019s Office building in Four\u202fCorners on Wednesday, marking the next phase of modernizing the county\u2019s law\u2011enforcement facilities. The 25,000\u2011square\u2011foot, 6.48\u2011acre site off Laura\u202fLouise Lane near Jackrabbit Lane was purchased for $5.4\u202fmillion in 2020 and has been occupied since the summer. The location, within a nine\u2011mile radius of most calls, \u201cSeventy percent of our calls occurring within that radius is pretty significant,\u201d Springer said. \u201cGetting our calls from here has been excellent and puts us right to where we need to be.\u201d The move also eliminates the need for deputies to navigate traffic on 19th\u202fAvenue and Huffine\u202fLane from the former office at the Gallatin County Detention Center.\n\nThe facility includes three shooting ranges\u2014one 100\u2011yard and a 25\u2011yard \u201cmost active bay\u201d\u2014space for patrol units, detectives, and the Missouri River Drug Task Force, and a main conference room where fireplaces crackled, dual TVs displayed, and cookies and coffee were served. Springer explained the financial rationale, noting, \u201cThere wasn\u2019t enough money to build a facility, which had been the plan to build our Sheriff\u2019s Office up by the jail,\u201d Springer said. \u201cSince we couldn\u2019t do that, there wasn\u2019t that kind of money available, so we ended up remodeling this to make it more fiscally\u2011responsible.\u201d While demonstrating the 25\u2011yard range he added, \u201cWe do most of our training here, this is by far the most active bay,\u201d Springer said. \u201cYou can do movements and cover and all that type of stuff but the only thing I would do differently is try and figure out a way to get a car down here (to train with).\u201d He further noted, \u201cWe train a lot in shooting, but when you look at the big picture, it\u2019s (mostly) traffic stops and domestic responses,\u201d Springer said. \u201c(Ranges were) the bonus to the facility. The primary objective when we purchased this was the fact that it\u2019s 6.48\u202facres, in the middle of Four\u202fCorners, which is where we\u2019re growing and where our primary routes are.\u201d\n\nThe tour\u2019s first stop featured a dedication to deputies who died in the line of duty, noting that over the past 160\u202fyears the office has lost five deputies, most recently Jake\u202fAllmendinger in 2019 after a patrol\u2011vehicle accident on Bridger Canyon Road\u2014a stretch that was dedicated to him in May. A Sheriff\u2019s Office chaplain recounted that two deputies were killed in 1917 while pursuing a suspect. County auditor Jill\u202fTherrien and CFO Justine\u202fSwanson attended the tour, and a new search\u2011and\u2011rescue building is under construction across the street as the county works toward a broader law\u2011enforcement and emergency\u2011response campus.",

    "content": "The Friends of the Easton Volunteer Fire Department received a $300,000 donation from Preston Automotive Group to fund an Emergency Services Training Campus in Easton, Maryland. \u201cPreston Automotive Group is proud to support an amazing project that will benefit the first responders in our local counties firsthand,\u201d said David Wilson\u202fJr., president of Preston Automotive Group. He added, \u201cWe are grateful to have so many brave men and women putting their lives on the line daily to make sure we are all safe. These men and women are the backbone of our community, the least we could do is contribute to a facility that will help train them and give them the resources they need to be as prepared as possible for situations that come their way while protecting us.\u201d\n\nLocated at 9095\u202fMistletoe Drive, the campus will serve Talbot County fire departments, emergency\u2011service personnel, law enforcement and paramedics. The project includes a 3,500\u2011square\u2011foot public\u2011safety building, a 3,600\u2011square\u2011foot classroom and storage building, and a 1,500\u2011square\u2011foot concrete pad for car\u2011fire, extrusion/stabilization and traffic\u2011safety training. Training will cover firefighting skills, rescue and motor\u2011vehicle fire/extraction for fire departments; hostage rescue, physical testing, traffic training, Homeland Security and K\u20119 for law enforcement; and classroom space for EMS. \u201cWe train together because we answer the call together,\u201d said Brett Whitehead, co\u2011chairman of the Public Safety Capital Campaign and president of the Friends of EVFD. He explained, \u201cThe donation from the Preston Automotive Group is an essential first step toward ensuring training available for all emergency services in Talbot County, including our volunteer firefighters, our law enforcement and our emergency services personnel and paramedics. The demand for these services continues to grow on the Mid\u2011Shore and this training campus will help meet this critical need.\u201d\n\nFor additional information or to contribute to the Friends of EVFD Public Safety Capital Campaign, contact Brett Whitehead at (302)\u202f236\u20116249 or whitenj20@gmail.com.

The combined loss of both buildings was estimated at $600,000, with the contents valued at $250,000.\n\nAccording to the fire marshal\u2019s report, \"The fire originated inside the butcher shop shortly after the owner had been doing work inside.

    "content": "For All Seasons is participating in the Governor\u2019s Maryland Regional Navigator Program, a statewide effort that serves human\u2011trafficking victims under the age of 24 on the Mid\u2011Shore. The organization\u2019s new human\u2011trafficking navigator, Susan Ahlstrom, is being linked with experts across Maryland to strengthen support for these victims.\n\nAhlstrom brings more than 25 years of nonprofit development, community building, education and youth\u2011advocacy experience, as well as a background in mental\u2011health counseling. She most recently served as the T.A.M.A.R. (Trauma, Addiction, Mental Health, and Recovery) coordinator for female detainees at the Dorchester and Caroline County detention centers, is a certified EFT/tapping practitioner, holds a Master of Science in Counseling from the University of Hartford and a Bachelor of Arts in English from William Smith College. She said, \u201cI hope to help mitigate the upward trend in Human Trafficking by expanding For All Seasons Rape Crisis Center's outreach; and strengthening the medical, legal, social service, and mental health collaboration that has already been established to support survivors. I believe my counseling and education background, along with strong communication and networking skills will help facilitate the most effective trauma\u2011informed response to serve victims and their families in the Mid\u2011Shore region and beyond,\u201d Ahlstrom said.\n\nThe article defines human trafficking as the use of force, fraud or threats to obtain labor or commercial sex acts against a person\u2019s will, noting that all persons under 18 who exchange sex for anything of value are victims regardless of coercion. The Eastern Shore\u2019s proximity to major highways (I\u201195, Routes\u202f40,\u202f50,\u202f301,\u202f13), three international airports, inexpensive bus and train services, and a high rate of seasonal work makes it attractive to traffickers.

While the ceremony highlighted Trams\u2019 advancement, it also marked Chief Paugh\u2019s announcement that he will soon leave Greensboro to join the Caroline County Sheriff\u2019s Office as commander of criminal investigations and a lieutenant.  \n\nAt the ceremony Trams expressed his gratitude, saying, \u201cWell, I'm very humbled,\u201d and added, \u201cI was recruited here to make a difference and reinstate the love for law enforcement, so I've been trying to do that for seven months, and I'm going to continue to do that. It's a great little town.\u201d He continued, \u201cI'm going to stay and watch this thing grow, and continue to give excellent service to the citizens and the town,\u201d Trams said. Town manager Tammy Kelledes praised him, saying, \u201cWe're very proud to have you, and you're doing a fantastic job,\u201d Kelledes said.  \n\nChief Paugh thanked attendees, stating, \u201cI want to thank you guys for taking your time out of your busy Monday to join Lenox on his special day. It's been a long time coming.\u201d He noted Trams\u2019 rapid impact, saying, \u201cEven though it's been a short period of time in Greensboro, you definitely made an impact in the community,\u201d he told Trams. Paugh added, \u201cI'm always stopped and told about how well you're doing and how you interact with the community, and that's huge. And that's who you are. You're Mr. Community Policeman,\u201d Paugh said, and concluded, \u201cYou've done some amazing things, and you're worthy of the rank.\u201d  \n\nTrams and Paugh both arrived in Greensboro seven months earlier after long careers with the Easton Police Department\u2014Trams, 48, after 22\u202fyears including a stint as a school resource officer, and Paugh, 50, after 26\u202fyears. Reflecting on the department\u2019s progress, Paugh said, \u201cWe made a big impact.\u201d He detailed upgrades, stating, \u201cWe completely redid all the cars - the technology in them. Everything is up to date,\u201d and, \u201cWe got a new CAD (computer-aided dispatch) system, new body cameras, new in-car cameras, all new computer systems\u201d \u2013 all updates the department \u201cvery, very much\u201d needed.  \n\nThe ceremony was attended by town officials, police leaders from neighboring jurisdictions, and department staff, underscoring the community\u2019s support for Trams\u2019 promotion and Paugh\u2019s forthcoming transition.",

Kepp said the incident occurred when a speeding driver, known to \u201chave a history of speeding and taunting police into chasing him,\u201d intentionally hit him as he tried to stop the vehicle. \u201cWhen I was brought into the conversation about new laws being created, right away, I knew it was something I wanted to do,\u201d Kepp said, adding that \u201cI will be there in Annapolis to make sure these bills happen.\u201d He spends each day from 9:45\u202fa.m. to 2:15\u202fp.m. in rehabilitation and has undergone a dozen surgeries since the crash.\n\nThe legislative push was announced in a press briefing with Montgomery County Executive\u202fMarc\u202fElrich and several county lawmakers. Del.\u202fGreg\u202fWims (D\u2011Montgomery) said, \u201cI\u2019m going to call it the Sgt. Pat Kepp Bill on Reckless Driving,\u201d calling Kepp a \u201chero.\u201d Elrich explained one proposed penalty: \u201cIt\u2019s way too easy for a driver to just pay a fine and get back on the road and do what they were doing before.\u201d Kepp said the measures would \u201cgive a little more teeth to some of our laws\u201d and would address the \u201coverall frustration\u201d with enforcing current reckless\u2011driving statutes, which he says lack sufficient fines and deterrence.\n\nThe two pending bills would broaden the criminal definition of reckless and negligent driving, increase penalties, and require offenders to appear in court rather than simply paying a fine. Elrich said he hopes the law will stop people from \u201cignoring lights and sirens from law enforcement, breaking the rules of the road \u2026 and performing car tricks like drifting, peeling out, and doing donuts in the middle of a road.\u201d He warned, \u201cAll it takes is a moment\u2019s loss of control over that vehicle,\u201d and added, \u201cInstead of being entertaining, it would take little to transform it into a deadly incident.\u201d The aim, Kepp emphasized, is not to imprison everyone but to end reckless driving, especially by repeat offenders, and to \u201cstrengthen our laws and make our roadways safer.\u201d",

    "content": "Tony Rose, the chief of 911 for Charles County, received unanimous permission from the Charles County commissioners on Feb.\u202f28 to travel to Annapolis and testify on House Bill\u202f1092, legislation that would require the Maryland 911 Board to set training standards for public\u2011safety answering point personnel on telecommunications CPR and expand the 911 Trust Fund to cover related training costs.  \n\nRose emphasized the urgency of rapid response, saying, \u201cWhen an out-of-hospital cardiac emergency occurs, you have about 600 seconds \u201410 minutes \u2014 to make a difference to save a life before irreversible brain death occurs,\u201d Rose said. In 2019 he learned of a new program to change how education is delivered to 911 call\u2011center operators and immediately brought in a specialist to evaluate current telecommunications personnel. \u201cIt was all over the board,\u201d Rose said referring to answers about the last time 911 operators had given over\u2011the\u2011phone CPR. \u201cSome had it done it yesterday, some had never done it.\u201d The program now requires a virtual training scenario every three months, putting operators through challenging situations to improve CPR instruction proficiency.  \n\n\u201cThe results have been phenomenal,\u201d Rose said. \u201cWe have doubled, and in some cases tripled, the number of survivors of out\u2011of\u2011hospital cardiac arrest in Charles County. They're walking out of a hospital after they've stopped breathing.\u201d A written testimony Rose provided to the board added, \u201cWe also reported that we had improved the application of bystander CPR from 27% to 43%, improved bystander application of an AED from 23.5% to 28.6% and saw the number of survivors that were discharged from the hospital increase from five to eleven.\u201d  \n\nCommissioner Ralph E. Patterson\u202fII (D) recalled a personal experience, noting, \u201cIt reminds me of an incident when I used to coach soccer,\u201d Commissioner Ralph E. Patterson II (D) said. \u201cWe had a cardiac arrest incident.\u201d He highlighted how the calm operator guided those present, underscoring the bill\u2019s importance. Rose concluded, \u201cCurrently, Charles County is the only jurisdiction that participates in this program,\u201d Rose said. \u201cThis bill would make it mandatory for 911 centers to provide, not necessarily this particular program, but one similar to it.\u201d",

The letter states, \u201cSince Schiraldi's appointment in 2022, his extreme policies and lack of leadership as the Secretary of the Department of Juvenile Services, have directly made communities less safe in Maryland,\u201d and adds, \u201cConsistently in Maryland, juveniles have been charged with serious violent crimes,\u201d followed by, \u201conly to be turned right back over to a parent or guardian, and back out on the streets to commit more crimes.\u201d The governors\u2019 office responded that \u201cover the past year,\u201d the administration has made a \u201cconcerted effort\u201d to hold youth accountable, citing a \u201c26% decline in juvenile homicide arrests and 46% decline in non-fatal shootings of juveniles\u201d and affirming, \u201cThe governor is fully committed to working with local elected officials, law enforcement, the judiciary, and community leaders to improve public safety by holding youth accountable and rehabilitating them,\u201d though it did not address the resignation request.\n\nSchiraldi, appointed by Moore in March\u202f2023, told WBAL\u2011TV, \u201cGov. Moore has been extremely supportive,\u201d and added, \u201cHe's gotten us additional funds this year \u2014 $17\u202fmillion to make community safer by expanding programs \u2014 and I want those community members who are calling for my resignation to feel safe.\u201d The Department of Juvenile Services has not yet commented on the sheriffs\u2019 letter.\n\nDorchester County Sheriff James Phillips explained his loss of confidence, saying he \u201clost all respect\u201d for Schiraldi after a community meeting where the secretary \u201chad the audacity to tell us, \u2026 \u2018The data that I'm receiving doesn't support your claim of increased juvenile crime,\u2019\u201d and Phillips replied, \u201cWell, obviously the numbers are going to go down because you're not allowing us to charge (them) anymore.\u201d Phillips noted, \u201cwe're dealing with the same people, the same names, the same age kids,\u201d and warned, \u201cThe law-abiding citizens are suffering because of their ignorance and stupidity in protecting these criminals,\u201d adding, \u201cAnd that's all they are. They might only be 15 or 16, but they're thugs.\u201d  \n\nTalbot County Sheriff Joe Gamble said there is \u201cno accountability,\u201d criticizing that \u201cgood\u201d juvenile\u2011services workers are \u201cbut they're being hampered by the secretary.\u201d He praised Talbot Teen Court, stating, \u201cThey're getting more community service and stuff out of Teen Court than they would ever get out of DJS,\u201d and concluded, \u201cIt's just a failed system. And it's being led by what the Sheriffs' Association believes is a bad pick by the governor.\u201d  \n\nCaroline County Sheriff Donnie Baker pointed to the 2022 Child Interrogation Protection Act as limiting police ability to charge juveniles, calling it a \u201cshame when parental rights are superseded by the legislature.\u201d Baker, a member of the state\u2019s juvenile\u2011justice reform commission, emphasized, \u201cJuvenile reform needs to be a high priority to help take the steps needed for them to have accountability for when they step into adulthood.\u201d",

That continues to be the case,\u201d Weber said. \u201c \u2026 There's a complexity to human trafficking that it doesn't really know county boundaries.\u201d She noted that a year ago the group reported that \u201ca good fifth of what was coming in was having at least one indicator of human trafficking,\u201d adding, \u201c \u2026 That persists.\u201d  \n\nWeber and Katie\u202fTheeke, vice\u2011president of marketing and communications, emphasized the nonprofit\u2019s regional reach across the five Mid\u2011Shore counties\u2014Caroline, Dorchester, Kent, Queen Anne\u2019s and Talbot\u2014stating, \u201cWe know that human trafficking knows no boundaries and that it affects people of different backgrounds, races, genders,\u201d Theeke said. \u201cWe have seen several cases come through our doors, and it comes from Talbot County. It comes from neighboring counties. We really aim to be the connector to get those people the help that they need.\u201d Weber said the organization is seeing a shift in how victims are identified: \u201cThe folks that are self\u2011referring, we're seeing a decline,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we're seeing a real rapid incline in folks coming to us and saying, 'Hey, I know more and now I've seen something.'\u201d Since September, more than 120 people have completed For All Seasons\u2019 free, online anti\u2011human\u2011trafficking course, and the group serves as the official regional navigator for the Mid\u2011Shore, participating in task forces and supporting youth and young adults who are victims.  \n\nCouncil members thanked the presenters and, on Tuesday, issued a proclamation designating January as National Human Trafficking Awareness Month.\u202fCouncil Vice President Pete\u202fLesher said, \u201cWe know that even one victim is too many,\u201d council Vice President Pete Lesher said. \u201cWe appreciate all that you do both on prevention, but also to develop and take care of those who have been victims.\u201d",

Officers from the Caroline County Sheriff\u2019s Office first chased Hockensmith through the northern part of the county before he escaped into a wooded area, prompting the involvement of the Maryland State Police, Delaware State Police and several other units.\n\nAt the Marydel property, Hockensmith was seen running to a car and fled the scene; the vehicle was later identified as stolen. \u201cThe vehicle was reported stolen to the Denton Police Department by Hertrich Chevrolet (in Denton), and we actually located another vehicle on the property that was stolen from them that they didn\u2019t even know about,\u201d Baker said. Police pursued the car through northern Caroline County until Hockensmith drove it off the roadway in the 16,000 block of Lentz Road in Henderson, Maryland, then fled on foot into a heavily wooded area where a perimeter, K\u20119 units and aviation support were deployed. After about three hours of searching, Hockensmith could not be located.\n\nThe investigation also led to the arrest of a female associate, Danyeal L.\u202fShahan, who is being held on bond at the Caroline County Detention Center and faces motor\u2011vehicle\u2011theft and related charges. \u201cThe Caroline County Sheriff's Office has active warrants for Hockensmith \u2018for the two motor vehicle deaths (of) two brand new cars from Hertrich Chevrolet here in Denton,\u2019\u201d Baker said. The Delaware State Police had earlier posted a request for public help, noting that Hockensmith \u201chas three active felony warrants for his arrest for a host of offenses, including theft, burglary and a police pursuit.\u201d The case remains active, and anyone with information is asked to contact the Caroline County Sheriff\u2019s Office at 410\u2011479\u20112515.",

Firefighters were dispatched at 3:07\u202fp.m., and by then flames were spreading quickly between the structures. Both residences were evacuated without serious injury, and the blaze was fully contained a little after two hours, with responding crews beginning to pull back before 5:30\u202fp.m. Seven volunteer fire departments\u2014including the Easton Volunteer Fire Department, Cordova Volunteer Fire Company, St.\u202fMichael\u2019s Fire Department, Preston Volunteer Fire Company, Oxford Fire Company, Queen Anne\u2011Hillsboro Volunteer Fire Company, and Trappe Volunteer Fire Company\u2014along with local EMS and law\u2011enforcement personnel, worked the incident.\n\nAmong the displaced was 87\u2011year\u2011old Leona Demdy, a lifelong Easton resident who lost a home she had lived in for 27\u202fyears. \u201cI cried, cried, cried,\u201d Demdy said as she watched firefighters extinguish the last remaining embers. \u201cI had everybody's picture on the wall. My walls were just full of pictures.\u201d The fire destroyed many of her personal belongings, including a collection of photographs of friends, family and neighbors that had been proudly displayed on her walls. Demdy, who lived alone, will stay with a relative near Salisbury while arrangements are made for her neighbors.\n\nThe state fire marshal has opened an investigation into the cause of the fire; the exact damages have not yet been determined, but both houses sustained significant damage and all residents were displaced. Demdy indicated she would be staying with family, and local officials have coordinated temporary housing for the other affected family. The investigation\u2019s findings will be released at a later date.",

The list highlights a range of public\u2011safety incidents and community events that captured readers\u2019 attention across Easton and surrounding counties.\n\nTop of the list is a police appeal for help identifying a man suspected of robbing a bank in Easton on Monday afternoon. A May\u202f20 discovery of human remains on the Ronald\u202fSpearing Farm during Cherrywood Solar construction follows, as does a serious crash on Route\u202f50 that injured four people, according to Maryland State Police. A homicide investigation began after deputies responded at about 1:15\u202fa.m. on June\u202f1 to reports of gunfire in the 1500 block of Centreville Road in Queen Anne\u2019s County. The week also saw Talbot and Queen Anne\u2019s counties named \u201csanctuary jurisdictions\u201d by the Trump administration, a designation later removed from the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s website.\n\nOther prominent stories include graduations at Easton High School and St.\u202fMichael\u2019s High School, a 12\u2011year\u2011old middle\u2011schooler becoming the youngest author of a fantasy novel, the removal of the tile wall at Idlewild Park after years of delay, a National Transportation Safety Board transcript revealing the final words from the Dali crew before the Key Bridge collapse, and a community rally to assist retired teacher and former baseball coach Dan Hortert after his home was damaged by an EF\u20111 tornado.",

    "content": "Students in grades 10 through 12 graduated from the Talbot County Sheriff\u2019s Office inaugural citizens police academy Tuesday night after a 10\u2011week course that met every Tuesday, covering crisis response, bleeding emergencies and traffic stops. The academy, held in Easton, MD, culminated with the graduation of Yvonne Herrera Hernandez (North Caroline High School), Ian Knopp (Saints Peter & Paul High School), Eric Loredo (Easton High School), Sofia Miller (St.\u202fMichael\u2019s Middle High School), Canin Parks (Saints Peter & Paul High School), Jules\u202fStepp (Saints Peter & Paul High School), Carson\u202fTyree (Saints Peter & Paul High School) and Evelio Urdaneta Delgado (Easton High School). The department is now accepting applications for a second citizens police academy open to county residents 18 and older, with classes beginning April\u202f8 and applications due March\u202f31.\n\nSaints Peter & Paul sophomore Carson\u202fTyree said the academy changed his perspective of police work. \u201cWhat stood out is how these guys work. It's not all fun and games,\u201d Tyree said. \u201c \u2026 When they go into a situation, there's a lot of thinking behind it because they can't violate procedure. If they violate procedure, they can't be a police officer.\u201d  Junior Jules\u202fStepp, who most enjoyed learning about Talbot County\u2019s crisis response unit, added, \u201cIt was like we were there with them,\u201d Stepp said. \u201cWe got to live vicariously through them.\u201d  She later reflected, \u201cI was surprised how much detail went into every little thing, and how one little thing can cause a problem so they had to backtrack and think about what the consequences could be,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd how they have to go through so many processes to get grants, peace orders, protective orders and all that type of stuff.\u201d\n\nFollowing the final class, Maj. Steve\u202fElliott thanked the students and called them a \u201cgreat group\u201d for the first ever citizens police academy. Lt. J.R.\u202fDobson said, \u201cI think from day one \u2014 when (Sheriff Joe Gamble) was giving you guys a lesson on when the first sheriff of Talbot County was \u2014 until now, I've seen you all loosen up,\u201d Dobson said. Sheriff Joe Gamble thanked grants administrator Lori\u202fStepp for securing the grant that made the academy possible and announced the upcoming program for adults.",

The contract\u2019s summary reads, \u201cContractor shall provide all labor and expertise for surveying, documenting, clean\u2011up, collecting, removal, and disposal services involving homeless encampment abatement actions on MDOT SHA property located in Charles County under an \u2018as needed\u2019 agreement basis.\u201d It calls for the removal of tents, mattresses, blankets, trash, debris, overfilled dumpsters, cardboard, tires, and \u201cdisposal of biohazardous waste, including human bodily fluids and waste and drug paraphernalia.\u201d The contract also states, \u201cThe site must be restored to a condition without obvious evidence of previous human habitation.\u201d\n\nA Charles\u202fCounty government spokesperson noted that because the encampment sits along two state roads, \u201cthe encampment is largely a state situation.\u201d The issue is not new; Corae Young, chief operating officer of Lifestyles of Maryland, told Southern Maryland News that a similar camp existed about a year ago and that Lifestyles had helped SHA deliver clearance notices. \u201cI believe what occurred is people moved close by,\u201d Young said.\n\nDuring a site visit on the morning of Aug.\u202f21, a reporter observed abundant debris\u2014bikes, shopping carts, bags, mattresses, cardboard, propane tanks and bottles\u2014alongside multiple lived\u2011in tents. One resident emerged as contractors walked the area, underscoring the difficulty of achieving the contract\u2019s requirement for a clean site.\n\nAfter the tour, Southern Maryland News contacted SHA. Daniel Allman of the agency\u2019s communications office said, \u201cSHA works in partnership with local agencies, including support and outreach services and law enforcement, to assist those residing on state rights\u2011of\u2011way. Connecting them with agencies that can provide relocation assistance, housing or other support services has proven to be a successful approach.\u201d He added that state workers inform residents they are on state property and give a \u201c30\u2011 to 60\u2011day timeframe for them to relocate.\u201d Despite the pending bid, Allman said, \u201cAt this time, there is no work scheduled for this location.\u201d\n\nBids for the contract are due Aug.\u202f28, but the agreement sets no fixed start date, and relocation efforts remain uncertain as of this week.",

But, it\u2019s to honor all emergency people who have passed away in the line of duty from Queen Anne\u2019s County.\u201d She added, \u201cIt means a lot. It really does. QAC is willing to step up, and support the families, and acknowledge the jobs that our law enforcement, our firefighters and our EMTs have done. It is very much appreciated.\u201d  \n\nQueen Anne\u2019s County State\u2019s Attorney Lance Richardson reflected on the community\u2019s response, saying, \u201cThe heroes we celebrate tonight were tragically taken from us. We don\u2019t have any control over that. But what we do have control over is how we respond to it, how we react, how we pick up the pieces and go on. Stoicism also places an emphasis on appreciating the unity and precious gift of life.\u201d During the remembrance, first\u2011responders marched for the Presentation of Colors, ten fallen heroes were honored\u2014including Daniel Lister, \u201cBuck\u201d\u202fClough, \u201cDougie\u201d\u202fThomas, David\u202fBrinkley, Michael\u202fNickerson, Jason\u202fSchwenz, Charles\u202fRider, and troopers Thomas\u202fNoyle, Philip\u202fRuss and Wallace\u202fMowbray\u2014and a radio transmission declared, \u201cToday we honor the memory and pay tribute to those who greatly served and protected QAC and the State of Maryland. May their dedication and sacrifice never be forgotten and may they rest in eternal peace.\u201d Bagpipes played \u201cAmazing Grace,\u201d and the church fell silent.\n\nRev.\u202fKaren\u202fHandy closed the ceremony with a prayer, proclaiming, \u201cLord, you gave them the gift of courage of serving others. Lord, mend those hearts that are broken in the loss of these loved ones. Lord, we pray that this memorial tonight has brought a bit of peace. Lord, we lift up and thank you for each of these persons. We thank you and pray for those that they have left behind.\u201d",

Johnson faced a first\u2011degree murder charge and entered an Alford plea in November\u202f2022. Under the plea deal he will serve his term at the Patuxent Youthful Offenders Program, become eligible for parole after serving half the sentence, and will also receive five years of probation. The sentence is retroactive to Jan.\u202f4,\u202f2022, the day Johnson was arrested by Cambridge police, and orders him to have no contact with Key\u2019Marion Ennals, who was acquitted of 12 charges\u2014including first\u2011degree murder\u2014at a trial in August.\n\nJohnson\u2019s sentencing was delayed as part of the agreement that required him to testify at Ennals\u2019 trial last month. In his initial police interview he admitted to carrying a .40\u2011caliber firearm, and an autopsy confirmed Woolford died from a single .40\u2011caliber gunshot wound.\n\nDorchester County State\u2019s Attorney Amanda Leonard issued a statement after the sentencing. She said, \u201cThe State recommended a sentence of life imprisonment, suspending all but forty years of active incarceration,\u201d and added, \u201cThe Court heard heartfelt victim impact statements from three members of the victim's family, each expressing their choice to forgive Mr. Johnson, and each requesting the Court consider a lesser period of active incarceration for Mr. Johnson given his cooperation and remorse.\u201d Leonard concluded, \u201cThe State continues to offer condolences to all family and loved ones impacted by the loss of Ja'Len Woolford, and thanks the Court for its mindful consideration of all circumstances at sentencing.\u201d",

Caroline County Public Schools moved Greensboro Elementary\u2019s students to the first floor, where limited heat from a backup generator kept the building operational. Colonel Richardson Middle School and Colonel Richardson High School remained open on generator power, offering students the option to go home and allowing parents to pick up children. Colonel Richardson High cancelled final exams. Breeding later remarked, \u201cI know it. It caused some havoc in a few of our schools,\u201d and added, \u201cI think Colonel Richardson Middle, Colonel Richardson High, and Greensboro Elementary had to react and make some changes. But I think all in all we got through it okay.\u201d\n\nThe county and the town of Denton opened warming shelters at the Choptank Visitor & Heritage Center and the General James\u202fF.\u202fFretterd Community Center, though staff reported no residents sought refuge. Power was fully restored in Caroline County around 1\u202fp.m., and by 1:45\u202fp.m. Choptank Electric confirmed that all its customers in the area had electricity. \u201cDelmarva power takes things very seriously, and I believe they did everything they could to restore power as quickly as possible,\u201d Breeding said.",

According to the Office of the Maryland State Fire Marshal, the fire originated in a rear first\u2011floor office and \u201cthe preliminary cause was deemed accidental, the result of\u202f\u2018an unspecified electrical event of a power surge protector.\u2019\u201d  \n\nA total of\u202f36\u202ffirefighters, led by Goodwill Volunteer Fire Company, responded and brought the fire under control in about\u202f30\u202fminutes.  Water collected in a back hallway, one special\u2011education classroom, an office and a conference room as the sprinklers ran for roughly\u202f20\u202fminutes.  The fire marshal estimated approximately\u202f$30,000\u202fin structure and content damages, and no injuries were reported.

    "content": "Easton Police Department\u2019s K\u20119 program was forced to start over after Maryland legalized recreational cannabis in July\u202f2023, which retired three marijuana\u2011detecting dogs.  The department\u2019s \u201ccomplete rebuild,\u201d as Lt. Tim Larrimore put it, began with the arrival of a nearly two\u2011year\u2011old black Labrador named Knox, who finished training in January\u202f2025 and was deployed 17 times in the first quarter, helping make six drug arrests with her handler, Pfc. Mark\u202fSchinault.  Schinault explained, \u201cShe has that drive for her reward, her toy after she does a good scan,\u201d and added, \u201cThat means the world to her, so she's very driven to work.\u201d\n\nOther agencies faced the same challenge.  Talbot County Sheriff Joe\u202fGamble said, \u201cI really didn\u2019t want to go down the road because I didn\u2019t want to be challenged in the courtroom.\u201d  Across the state, law\u2011enforcement leaders are rebuilding their units, often with untrained puppies to cut costs.  \u201cMost of the agencies were able to replenish the dogs,\u201d said Kent County Sgt. Scott\u202fLockerman, president of the Maryland Police K\u20119 Foundation, which funded one of Easton\u2019s new dogs.  At Dorchester County Sheriff\u2019s Office, Sheriff James\u202fPhillips recalled, \u201cWe saw it coming.\u202fIt was on the horizon,\u201d and noted that funding has been \u201cmind\u2011boggling\u201d in generosity.  Larrimore explained the new reality: \u201cThis odor of marijuana was enough before 2023 to give us probable cause to search.\u202fNow that\u2019s out,\u201d adding, \u201cSo now you need the ability to smell something that the human nose isn\u2019t necessarily good at detecting.\u202fIt\u2019s the dog that gets you there.\u201d  He also said, \u201cIt hasn\u2019t hit us yet.\u202fThese dogs are just retired last year.\u202fThey\u2019re young, they\u2019re healthy.\u201d\n\nThe rebuilt K\u20119 teams are proving valuable beyond narcotics work.  Dorchester Sgt. Steve\u202fTwilley said the dogs \u201cbridge the gap between the Sheriff\u2019s Office and the community\u201d and noted, \u201cNext thing you know, that kid\u2019s come to you for help instead of lashing out or doing something at school.\u201d  Phillips echoed the return on investment, stating that money spent on K\u20119s comes back \u201c10\u202ftimes over because of the relationships that we build with the kids and the people.\u201d  He concluded, \u201cI think an agency that\u2019s trying to do today\u2019s police work and doesn\u2019t have the K\u20119 ability out there, I don\u2019t think they\u2019re a full police agency.\u202fI think it completes the police agency by having the K\u20119s.\u201d  \n\nThe effort to rebuild Maryland\u2019s K\u20119 units continues, with Easton already adding a second dog, Waylon, and two more untrained pups slated to join, while other counties secure funding through grants, donations, and foundations to maintain the vital roles dogs play in detection, tracking, explosives work, and community policing.",

Deputies responded at approximately\u202f1:15\u202fa.m. and found Parsley, who had been attending a bonfire with friends, fatally shot; life\u2011saving measures were attempted but he was pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nDetectives from the Sheriff\u2019s Office Criminal Investigation Unit launched an immediate investigation, working with the FBI Baltimore\u2011Annapolis Field Office, the Chesapeake Bay Safe Streets Task Force, Homeland Security Investigations\u2019 Baltimore Eastern Shore Field Office, Maryland State Police Centreville Barrack, Centreville Police Department, Delaware State Police and related agencies. After an extensive probe, a Queen Anne\u2019s County grand jury returned indictments and arrest warrants were issued on Oct.\u202f6. Andrews faces multiple counts of attempted second\u2011degree murder, manslaughter, first\u2011 and second\u2011degree assault, reckless endangerment, several firearm offenses and possession of a firearm as a minor. Lawson is charged with attempted second\u2011degree murder, manslaughter, assault, reckless endangerment, firearm\u2011related offenses, conspiracy to alter physical evidence, possession of a firearm as a minor and possession of a firearm without a serial number. Lissau faces similar charges, including attempted second\u2011degree murder, manslaughter, assault, reckless endangerment, firearm offenses, conspiracy to alter evidence and possession of a firearm without a serial number. All three suspects are being held without bond.\n\nSheriff Gary Hofmann said, \u201cThis has been an incredibly difficult time for Chris' family and for our entire community. The effects of this tragedy have been deeply felt, and our thoughts remain with those who continue to grieve. This investigation reflects the strength of collaboration between our community and our law enforcement partners.\u201d He added, \u201cAs the investigation continues, every tip, video, and witness account remains vital to bringing closure for Chris's family and our community. We have zero tolerance for crime in Queen Anne's County and will always stand up for victims who no longer have a voice.\u201d The investigation remains ongoing, and officials urge anyone with information to call the Anonymous Tip Line at\u202f410\u2011758\u20116666 or email\u202fSheriff\u2011Info@qac.org.",

    "content": "An Easton man, Travis\u202fSchwaninger, 42, was arrested on eight counts of possession of child pornography after a joint investigation led by the Criminal Investigations Division of the Talbot County Sheriff\u2019s Office. The investigation began in April when the Easton Police Department\u2019s Criminal Investigations Unit received several tips about Schwaninger from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. Because Schwaninger lived outside Easton\u2019s jurisdiction, the department contacted the Sheriff\u2019s Office to take over the case.\n\nOn June\u202f11, detectives executed a search warrant at Schwaninger\u2019s home and recovered additional evidence from his electronic devices, according to a news release from the Talbot County Sheriff\u2019s Office. Schwaninger was arrested on site, transported to the Talbot County Detention Center and later released on a $20,000 unsecured bond.\n\nThe Talbot County Sheriff\u2019s Office Patrol Division, Drug Task Force and Crisis Response Unit, together with the Easton Police Department and the Maryland State Police Computer Crimes Unit, assisted in the investigation. Anyone with information about the case can contact Cpl. Samuel\u202fFaggert at 410\u2011822\u20111020 or sfaggert@talbotcountymd.gov.",

    "content": "On Monday, September\u202f23,\u202f2025, the Federalsburg Town Council convened a special meeting to discuss a draft Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Caroline County Sheriff\u2019s Office that would transfer policing duties from the town\u2019s police department to the sheriff\u2019s deputies. The proposed one\u2011year contract would assign four officers to Federalsburg: former police department Sgt.\u202fBrian\u202fMcNeill, two police\u2011academy cadets, and one current sheriff\u2019s deputy. Town officials said the agreement is intended to help address Federalsburg\u2019s $5\u202fmillion debt by reducing policing costs, noting that the town currently spends $1.146\u202fmillion annually on its police department while the sheriff\u2019s coverage would cost about $863,000\u2014an estimated saving of $280,000, though earlier estimates projected savings of $300,000\u2011$500,000 per year.\n\nCouncil members indicated that the MOU includes provisions for regular public oversight, with quarterly meetings planned throughout the year. \u201cWe felt as we wanted to give this MOU situation a try for a year, and throughout that year we want to have quarterly meetings with the public,\u201d Council Member Brandy\u202fJames said at an Aug.\u202f3 meeting. Additional details of the draft agreement call for the town to provide police vehicles, covering gas and maintenance, and to allocate a $15,000 line item for officer uniforms. The sheriff\u2019s office would handle press releases for criminal events, while the town would manage releases related to municipal events. Discussions with Sheriff Donnie\u202fBaker also explored the possibility of sharing the police department building, using half for town offices and half for sheriff\u2019s deputies.\n\nA motion to advance the modified agreement was made contingent on Town Attorney Lyndsey\u202fRyan making clarifying revisions. If approved, the MOU would remain in effect for one year, after which the council could assess its performance and financial impact before deciding on any further action.",

The grants support Maryland\u2019s Vision\u202fZero goal of eliminating all traffic fatalities and serious injuries by 2030. \u201cIn order to create the transportation system that Marylanders deserve, we must work with our citizens, our local officials and our Congressional delegation with unity and focus to deliver safe, equitable access across the state for everyone, whether they drive, ride, or walk,\u201d Gov. Wes\u202fMoore said. \u201cThese grants help us achieve that goal and help fulfill our mission to lift every community.\u201d Maryland Transportation Secretary Paul\u202fWiedefeld added, \u201cThe Maryland Department of Transportation is proud to have worked closely with our federal delegation to support our local partners' efforts to receive more than $28\u202fmillion in funding to boost safety for those who bike, walk and drive on our roads,\u201d and \u201cThe Maryland Department of Transportation looks forward to working with local leaders throughout the state to put this money to use to reduce roadway fatalities and ensure our streets are safer for all Marylanders.\u201d\n\nAmong the awards, the City of Mount Rainier received the largest implementation grant at over $9.7\u202fmillion for traffic\u2011calming measures, bicycle\u2011network improvements, sidewalk enhancements and pedestrian safety near Mount Rainier Elementary School. The Town of Brentwood was granted $160,000 to develop a Vision\u202fZero Action Plan. \u201cAs a historically disadvantaged community, we're grateful for this federal investment and support of our county and state partners so that we can deliver safety for our residents, businesses and visitors,\u201d Brentwood Mayor Rocio\u202fTreminio\u2011Lopez said. \u201cWhile a small town, we have urban issues that need collaborative approaches to solve.\u201d Baltimore County received $3.5\u202fmillion for its Vision\u202fZero Action Plan, with County Executive Johnny\u202fOlszewski stating, \u201cInvesting in our roadways not only improves vital infrastructure, but prioritizes the safety and wellbeing of our residents and communities,\u201d and \u201cWe are grateful to our federal and state partners for their help with the critical planning projects supported with this grant \u2013 and for helping to ensure Baltimore County's roads are safe for years to come.\u201d\n\nQueen Anne\u2019s County was awarded $280,000 to develop a comprehensive multimodal safety plan. \u201cThis federal grant will help our local, state and federal partners combine knowledge and resources to create a comprehensive highway safety plan that will improve safety for our citizens and everyone traveling though Queen Anne's county,\u201d County Commissioner Jim\u202fMoran said. The City of Cambridge received $320,000 for research on reorganizing streets to make them safer and more pedestrian\u2011friendly.

Local police confirmed the accident remains under investigation, and no injuries were reported. The truck managed to get only halfway across the tracks before being struck, leaving the corn spill beside the rails and the truck cab twisted as if it were driving on the tracks.\n\nLeon Guin, a jockey driver at Amick Farms on Nealson Street near the crash site, said he saw the incident moments after it occurred. He recounted, \u201cOur security guards heard the accident,\u201d he said, \u201cand two of our outside drivers saw and heard it also. They were bringing the chickens in at that time.\u201d From his viewpoint, Guin could see the truck cab and the front portion of the trailer wrapped around the side of the train, with the covered load spilling onto the rail line.\n\nPresident and General Counsel for Maryland and Delaware Railroad Company Cathrin\u202fBanks said she believed the train operators had done everything required when approaching the crossing. Police shut access at the Nealson Street entrance of Amick, rerouting traffic through the Route\u202f392 and Delaware Avenue entrance, and cleanup was still ongoing four hours later. Hurlock Chief of Police Bruce Jones noted at press time that he could not yet release further details, including the truck driver\u2019s name and the hauling company.",

The blaze caused roughly $25,000 in damage, but the Office of the State Fire Marshal reported no injuries. The Rev.\u202fGary\u202fMoore said the damage is \u201cvery, very significant\u201d for the small church, which dates to the 1880s. \u201cI was there last night,\u201d Moore said in an interview Wednesday. \u201cAssessing the building will be a difficult decision as we move into the future.\u201d\n\nThe Trappe Volunteer Fire Company, assisted by neighboring fire departments, controlled the fire in about 20\u202fminutes, according to the fire marshal\u2019s report. Moore thanked the crews, noting \u201cIt\u2019s what makes living in Talbot County a joy.\u201d Sunday morning services at the Bruceville church will be moved to Trappe United Methodist Church on Maple Avenue.\n\nElsewhere in Talbot County, the storm felled around nine trees, downed wires, caused some flooding and a few minor car accidents. Talbot County Emergency Services Director Brian\u202fLeCates said, \u201cWe had a total of 24 incidents that were storm-related,\u201d and added, \u201cMost of them are trees down with wires and then just flooding on streets down in Oxford and here in Easton.\u201d He urged residents to avoid driving through flooded waters and to \u201cPrepare your homes for loose objects that will be blowing around,\u201d and to \u201cSecure loose objects.\u201d  \n\nCommerce Drive in Easton was temporarily closed by flooding Tuesday night but reopened shortly after. The St.\u202fMichaels town office will be closed Thursday for repairs to an electric pole lost in the storm, though no further outages are expected. Dorchester County emergency management planner Jimmy Windsor reported no major flooding or significant damages, noting only tree damage in the county\u2019s northern parts. In Caroline County, a few downed trees were cleared from roadways by mid\u2011Wednesday. Easton Utilities reported two customers without power Tuesday night; President and CEO John\u202fHorner said, \u201cEvery upgrade we make strengthens our system, reduces outages, and ensures we\u2019re prepared to meet growing demands.\u201d  \n\nThe National Weather Service\u2019s Mount Holly/Philadelphia office issued a flood\u2011watch alert for Caroline and Talbot counties from 5\u202fp.m. Wednesday to 2\u202fa.m. Thursday, indicating that thunderstorms are expected to continue.",

Thompkins began striking the woman with his fists, then brandished a knife to stab her neck.The woman ran from her vehicle and collapsed in the front yard of a nearby house. Thompkins cradled her while holding the knife to his own throat, Franklin said.A witness attempted to help the victim but Thompkins threatened them, pointing the knife at them and yelling for them to get back.Multiple law enforcement agencies, including the Caroline County Sheriff's Office, Maryland State Police and Maryland Natural Resources Police, responded to the stabbing.Franklin said Thompkins punctured his own neck with a knife while running to the woods, evading officers.After 15 minutes and the use of multiple non-lethal methods, including a taser, to diffuse the situation, a state trooper was able to knock the knife out of Thompkins' hand to detain him, police said.Both Thompkins and the woman were flown to the University of Maryland Shock Trauma Center in Baltimore for treatment of their injuries.Following his arrest, a judge found Thompkins incompetent to stand trial in April 2022.He was committed to the Maryland Department of Health until August of this year, then transferred back to a local detention center upon being found competent, according to court filings.In court Monday, Franklin said he will recommend a 30-year sentence with all but 15 years of active incarceration suspended, followed by five years of supervised probation and special mental health conditions.State sentencing guidelines recommend five to 10 years, said Jesse Hicks, Thompkins' attorney. The plea is not binding, meaning a judge has the ability to impose a higher or lower sentence than what is recommended.Sentencing will be deferred until Feb. 1, 2024. \n \n Caption: PHOTO BY MIKE DETMER\n \nPolice on scene in Preston for a reported stabbing Thursday, Feb. 17, 2022. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The woman, who is not named in court filings, is seeking relief from the court for physical, psychological and emotional injuries she said she incurred while seeking treatment for her child in his office in 2023.\nAccording to court documents, the woman was touched inappropriately and in a sexual manner while in the treatment room with Ramirez and her daughter. Following the encounter, which she said she tried to rebuff, the woman notified office staff and subsequently filed a report with the Chestertown Police Department.\nIn September 2023, the woman made a formal complaint to the Maryland State Board of Physicians.\nThrough the course of the board's investigation, four former employees \"all testified to a pervasive environment of sexually abusive, unethical, and inappropriate behavior,\" according to the investigation report.\nThe investigation found Ramirez, on multiple occasions, sexually assaulted at least three female employees of his over the course of several years. The investigation further found that he sexually assaulted at least one other mother while in the course of treating her child.\nFollowing the board's initial inquiry into the allegations in April, the board ordered a summary suspension of Ramirez's license, concluding \"the public health, safety or welfare imperatively required emergency action in this case.\"\nAs a result of the board's investigation, Ramirez permanently surrendered his license to practice medicine, according to a letter Ramirez sent to the board.\nAs listed by the Maryland Board of Physicians, Ramirez, 65, graduated from Universidad de El Salvador Facultad de Medicina in 1988. He was first licensed in Maryland in 1998.\nRamirez opened his first office in Chestertown in 1999. According to information on his practice's website, he opened a second office in Centreville in 2004 to \"better serve the Queen Anne's and neighboring communities.\" In February of 2015, he moved this office to the Shore Medical Pavilion in Queenstown. Hospital affiliations include the Anne Arundel Medical Center and Chester River Hospital Center.\nThe woman, named Jane Doe in the court filings, is represented by Schlachman, Belsky, Weiner & Davey of Baltimore. The complaint was filed by Michael J. Belsky and Catherine A. Dickinson.\nIn a statement released to the press, the law firm attorneys state Ramirez grabbed their client's breasts, vagina and buttocks in the course of examining her daughter. The attorneys state it is likely there are other victims.\n\"As alleged in the Complaint, Dr. Ramirez was a serial abuser of women. Our office is actively investigating these instances of abuse, especially against mothers who were assaulted while the doctor was treating their children. It goes without saying that this behavior is not acceptable, and we intend to hold the doctor accountable for his actions. We encourage anyone with information on these allegations to reach out to us,\" Belsky and Dickinson said in an interview with the Kent County News.\nRamirez's office is not taking phone calls. A message on his website states, \"It is with a heavy heart that I announce my office has closed permanently. Due to unforeseen circumstances, and after careful deliberation, I have decided to retire and close my practice. I assure you that this decision was not made lightly, and I am deeply saddened that I will no longer be able to serve you and our community as a pediatrician.\"\nHe continues, \"I would like to thank you for your time and the trust you have given me during our many years of operation in Chestertown. Taking care of your family was an honor and a privilege for me and my staff. My years here have been filled with countless rewarding experiences and the most remarkable patients. These shared moments will be remembered fondly, and will always be with me.\"\nContacted Tuesday morning, Kent County State's Attorney Brian DiGregroy was not able to immediately respond to inquires regarding any criminal charges. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Police said McClain had an active Dorchester County District Court arrest warrant.Charges stem from an Oct. 3 incident where the Cambridge Police Department said officers responded to the 400 block of Caribbean Avenue around 1:40 a.m. regarding an armed robbery.Police said officers contacted the victim, who reported that after leaving their residence with a friend, another male subject came from the side of the residence, approaching the victim and knocking them to the ground.Police said the victim reported that the teen pulled out a handgun pointing and threatening to shoot them as he went through the victim's pockets, taking their wallet and vehicle keys. The victim then observed the friend he had met with, and the other male suspect get into the vehicle and leave the area.An investigation determined the suspect with the gun was a 17-year-old boy from Cambridge, police said. The teen was arrested and and charged as an adult.Police said that upon further investigation, McClain was identified as the \"friend\" of the victim.After being processed by CPD and having an initial appearance before a court commissioner, McClain was transported to the Dorchester County Department of Corrections on no bond. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Crankshaw-Quimby noted that the shelter has yet to reach its busiest time of the year for kitten, which is in the later summer months and early fall.\n\"This is a trend we are seeing across the country,\" Crankshaw-Quimby said. \"I am the president of Professional Animal Workers of Maryland, the state association of shelters and animal control agencies, and we are seeing crisis level intake in our larger municipalities.\"\nA similar trend is being seen in Caroline County.\nKaren Culotta, director of the Caroline County Humane Society, said the number of dogs at the animal shelter has increased significantly over the past four years.\nThe shelter is currently at 95% capacity. Though Culotta said they spend all their efforts caring for all the animals they can, the influx has overwhelmed the shelter.\nCulotta acknowledged that it is difficult to determine the exact reason for the influx. She said it seems to go beyond issues of pets going without being spayed or neutered. She speculates that it could be economically driven.\n\"For some people, with the cost of vet care going up, with the cost of everything going up, or, since the pandemic, sometimes (people) can't afford to feed their animals or can't afford to get vaccinations, which is required of every cat and dog in the state of Maryland,\" Culotta said. \"It's very challenging for everybody here.\"\nCrankshaw-Quimby said that the Talbot County Shelter has embedded essential programs to help address the large number of animals the shelter is facing.\n\"We work very hard to keep animals out of the shelter with our robust assortment of programs; however, being an open admission shelter that turns no county resident in need of surrendering their pet away, as well as performing the role of animal control, one large animal control seizure or a wave of animal surrenders could put us over the top,\" Crankshaw-Quimby said. \"This is why the foster, spay/neuter and intervention programs are so very important.\"\nCulotta said she has contacted directors of other local shelters, and they have noted the \"odd\" rise in intake.\n\"It's definitely a crisis here on the Eastern Shore,\" Culotta said.\nCulotta and Crankshaw-Quimby encouraged residents to partake in spray/neuter programs and to sign-up to take in foster animals, particularly dogs, at a local shelter. Participating in these programs can assist shelters as they go through high animal intake, they said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Organizations on the Shore hosts count of people experiencing homelessness\n\n January 31, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: News \n \n 599\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON \u2014 From Queen Anne's County to Dorchester County many churches, libraries and senior centers assisted as various organizations hosted a point-in-time, a count of all experiencing unsheltered and sheltered homelessness.In Caroline County alone, approximately 142 people were reported to be in attendance on Wednesday. Jimmy Morris, continuum of care housing specialist for Mid-Shore Behavioral Health, said the count in Dorchester County recorded its highest ever number of people experiencing homelessness. Finalized numbers for the Mid-Shore will not be available for several weeks.\nMorris said large efforts were made to reach this specific population, from media outreach to visiting encampments. He said this larger effort was made due to the growing population of homelessness on the Shore.\nOver the last few years, the population of people experiencing homelessness has skyrocketed on the Eastern Shore, and organizations focused on assisting this population are working to have a proper count in order to better secure funds to provide resources.\nAshley Kessinger, continuum care manager at Mid-Shore Behavioral Health, said this winter the organization's shelters were filled with people trying to stay warm.\n\"It's been a crisis,\" Kessinger said. \"Our shelters are completely full, and they stay full all the time. They're all working off of waitlists. They're all trying to find other ways so that people that come to them, don't have to turn them away. But they're just full and we don't have enough.\"\nAccording to Kessinger, the results of the data gathered by each jurisdiction will be submitted to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and can be used to secure grant funding.\nYvette Robinson, grant manager at Neighborhood Service Center, was distributing information at the Fredrick Douglas room of the Talbot County Free Library in Easton, one of the locations for the county Wednesday. Robinson said homelessness on the Eastern Shore looks different in comparison to homelessness in major cities. One of those contributing factors, she said, is resources.\n\"The numbers are growing, the resources are not,\" Robinson said. \"We rely on community partners to try to collaborate so that we can see what's working, what may not be working \u2026we're just trying to get the information out that there are variable resources.\"\nAccording to Robinson, since Nov. 24, 2024, Neighborhood Service Center has given out 9,000 pounds of food and served over 600 families, a majority of which were homeless.\nKessinger said a contributing factor to the growing homeless population has been a lack of affordable housing on the shore. Many of the people served at Mid-Shore Behavioral Health either have no income or they receive funds from Social Security which can be about $900 a month.\nA lack of affordable housing has made the issue worse but it is the mark of homelessness that will make it difficult to get landlords to consider working on affordable housing alternatives.\nIn her experience, there are some landlords that refuse to help customers that her organization works with because the customers have experienced homelessness. Kessinger said there is an assumption that the customers will be bad tenants or bad people in general.\nFor Kessinger, everyone deserves help and people shouldn't treat those experiencing homelessness differently because of their circumstance because it can happen to anyone at any time.\n\"People think homelessness looks a certain way and we have seen people from all walks of life and it does not look a certain way,\" Kessinger said. \"There's a lot of stigma on the shore about homelessness and some people just don't want to see it. If they come across an encampment or something like that, they just want it to go away. \u2026everyone deserves a chance to have a home.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

This year's training brought Talbot and Caroline sheriff's deputies, Easton police, local EMTs and paramedics, and others to The Country School.\nCaroline County Cpl. Kenny Tull led a drill Thursday afternoon, showing me just how critical it is that first responders from different counties to work together cohesively under stress.\nAnd the results were enlightening: officers and EMTs didn't always make the correct decision every split-second, but they did confer with each other on what steps to take during the next drill, learning how to get better along the way.\nTo learn more about the training, read my story below. Also in today's newsletter: Talbot Mentors helps local students achieve their goals, a conservation easement will become a public park in Dorchester County and more.\nThanks for reading.\n\u2014 Konner Metz \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "'25 kids should not take this whole city down' - Cambridge council grapples with youth crime in city\n\n September 14, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato; mtrovato@chespub.com | Page: 5 | Section: News \n \n 610\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE - Youth issues were the overwhelming theme for the third Cambridge City Council meeting in a row.At the Sept. 12 meeting, residents and commissioners alike made comments about juvenile crime.Lance Cephas, who is the father of Commission President Lajan Cephas and Commissioner Sputty Cephas, said crime is affecting everyone, including the children and families who aren't part of the problem.He further noted the children who aren't contributing to juvenile crime are being punished for the actions of about 25 children, \"25 kids should not take this whole city down,\" he said.Lance Cephas stressed the importance of educating the kids that are caught doing things they shouldn't be.\"Because if you send them back home to that same environment, ain't nothing going to happen,\" he said. \"A lot of police officers, they'll pick them up, they'll let them go, and soon as they're around the corner, they've done something else to somebody else. So you've got to get them and educate them.\" He said he understood both his children's, Lajan and Sputty, and Mayor Stephen Rideout's points of view regarding the juvenile curfew but said the council shouldn't be \"at each other's throats\" and \"controlled by 25 kids.\" \"We've all got to come together,\" he said.In late August, Rideout vetoed a juvenile curfew ordinance which commissioners had passed Aug. 14.Before that, in July, Rideout had proposed an alternative curfew ordinance which had additions and changes from the original curfew ordinance. These included adding definitions and altering language on enforcement procedures and penalties.Since Rideout vetoed the original curfew ordinance, Sputty Cephas has made amendments to Rideout's alternative ordinance in an effort to compromise and \"find middle ground.\" According to council meeting documents, Cephas plans to recommend these amendments Sept. 25 when Rideout's proposed ordinance will be read for a second time.During the meeting, Sputty Cephas talked about finding that middle ground.\"Commissioner Atkiss made a point to say that $100 is a lot of money for a struggling parent,\" he said.\"My day job is in banking, so I understand that struggle as well.\" Sputty Cephas said he would like to keep fines as part of the penalty for not following the curfew, but said he cut them in half in his amendment. Instead of a $100 fine, it would be $50.At the end of the meeting, Rideout suggested to Sputty Cephas that the two of them get together to talk about the proposed amendments to the alternative ordinance. Sputty Cephas agreed to meet.Two presentations were given during Monday's meeting, as well. One presentation was given by Pam Gregory, president and CEO of United Way of the Lower Eastern Shore, and one by Lisa Molock, chief executive director at Let's Thrive Baltimore and an organizer for Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America.Molock talked about the work she has been doing in Baltimore, and Gregory talked about the economic issues that many Marylanders face. She shared data from a report that focused on asset limited, income constrained and employed (or ALICE) Marylanders and shared data on Dorchester County residents specifically. Gregory said that in Dorchester County, 45% of residents are below the ALICE threshold.During public comment, Theresa Stafford said poverty is a \"lead driver\" for many other issues in Cambridge.\"We need to get serious about fixing the problem of poverty,\" Stafford said.\"Bringing in industries or businesses that will pay good wages, and of course, supporting getting kids educated because that's the other key driver that keeps driving up the crime.\" \n \n Caption: MAGGIE TROVATO/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nPam Gregory, CEO of United Way of the Lower Eastern Shore, gives a presentation at a Cambridge City Council meeting on Sept. 11. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

MICHAELS \u2014 Firefighters across the Mid-Shore worked together to put out a large town house fire in St. Michaels on Saturday. No injuries were reported.Around 1:20 p.m. Saturday, the St. Michaels Fire Department responded to a fire at a six-unit town house complex on Martingham Circle. Assistant Chief Phil Jones said a second alarm was requested. Agencies from Talbot, Caroline, Dorchester and Queen Anne's counties assisted, with at least 70 people on the scene.\nThe fire was caused by an electrical failure with an HVAC system in the attic, according to the Maryland Office of the State Fire Marshal.\nJones said two of the six units will be \"displaced for some time.\" A third unit incurred small fire damage, a fourth unit sustained water damage and the other two units were unharmed, he said.\nThe fire marshal's office estimates $1 million in damages to the structure and contents.\nFirst responders were able to extinguish most of the fire in the first hour of efforts. Jones said firefighters were on scene for over four hours Saturday to fully handle the blaze. They had to be mindful of the hot conditions.\n\"With the heat, it makes it twice as hard for us,\" Jones said. \"Usually a firefighter can only work five to 15 minutes in the heat\" without taking a break, he added.\nAll firefighters were required to receive a medical check on their vitals, Jones said. Crews went through over 20 cases of bottled waters.\nJones emphasized that the firefighters on scene were all volunteers. He expressed appreciation for the responding units from surrounding counties, as the additional manpower was necessary for such a hot day. Jones said there was good cooperation with the homeowners and between fire agencies.\n\"We all work together to complete everything,\" Jones said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Students and staff were evacuated into the stadium and are safe, police say.\nPolice say students who are car riders are being picked up at the Easton Elks Lodge, students who are bus riders are riding buses and students who are walkers can walk home.\nAs of 3:01 p.m., \"all buses (were) being loaded and released from EHS,\" according to police. All after-school activities are canceled.\nTalbot County Public Schools sent EHS families a message at around 2:15 p.m. on Monday.\n\"Easton High has received a Bomb threat. At this time the school is on lockdown,\" the message stated. \"We are waiting further direction from law enforcement.\"\n\"This is an ongoing investigation and Deputies will be on scene for several hours,\" Talbot County Sheriff's Office stated. \"Please avoid the area and obey police detours. We will be sure to release additional information as soon as it becomes available.\"\nEarlier on Monday, the Talbot County Sheriff's Office said it was investigating a threat made on social media.\nSheriff Joe Gamble said Monday morning that the threat, which originated on Instagram, was not a specific threat to Talbot County Public Schools, but to the 410 area code. It was not immediately shared by law enforcement if the Easton High lockdown resulted from this threat or from a separate threat.\nOn Monday morning, Gamble said all school resource officers in the district were aware of the threat, and extra deputies were patrolling.\nOn Friday, TCPS students were put in a modified lockdown following a threatening social media post made that morning. According to the Sheriff's Office, the threat originated outside of the United States and similar threats were made to schools in Easton, Pennsylvania.\nThis report will be updated. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Family fights Dunkirk cemetery's plan to move plot\n\n December 10, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARTY MADDEN mmadden@somdnews.com | Section: State News \n \n 508\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n According to her daughter, it was in 1989 that Gloria Moseley purchased two plots at Dunkirk's Southern Memorial Gardens. It was supposed to be a modest resting place in a quiet rural setting.Laura Dodgson, Moseley's daughter who now lives in North Carolina, said her sister died in 1994 and her brother died four years later. Urns containing their ashes were buried side-by-side on the site.\nGloria Moseley died in 2002 and eight years later her husband, Robert, passed. Both were laid to rest at the family gravesite.\nSouthern Memorial Gardens has had different owners since 1989, when the Moseleys purchased the plots.\nNow the cemetery owners say mistakes have been made. Their solution has brought distress to the family.\nIn a letter to Southern Maryland News, Dodgson said she received a phone call from cemetery officials back in September.\n\"They stated that my family had been buried in the wrong plot and that they would have to be dug up and moved,\" Dodgson wrote.\nDuring a phone conversation with Dodgson after the letter was received, Southern Maryland News learned cemetery officials, via mail, told her to sign papers for moving the family members to another location.\n\"I don't want them moved,\" Dodgson said.\nWhen Southern Maryland News contacted the cemetery about the situation, the employee answering the phone provided contact information for the business's attorney, Kevin Vitelli.\n\"It happens at every cemetery,\" Vitelli said of the Moseley family's situation. \"Mistakes were made in 1989. We're just trying to make it right.\"\nVitelli, whose law practice is based in Pennsylvania, said the relocation of the family's plot would be done at no additional cost.\nThe local cemetery has a well-documented history of problems.\nNearly 20 years ago, fraudulent activity on the part of former owner, Larry Deffenbaugh, came to light after a Maryland State Police investigation. Deffenbaugh was later convicted of defrauding over 500 people out of funeral and memorial items.\nHe had entered an Alford plea, which is not an admission of guilt, but an acknowledgment that prosecutors have evidence to support a charge, received a 15-year suspended sentence and ordered to pay restitution to the victims.\nDeffenbaugh's story then gets more convoluted, as he was summoned back to court for a violation of probation hearing but failed to appear. Apparently not wishing to go to prison, Deffenbaugh reportedly fell off a fishing boat. He was, however, recaptured in 2010 and sent to prison.\nDodgson said her late sister's daughter, Pam, filed court papers to have her mother's urn removed from the cemetery and given over to her. Dodgson and another family member confirmed that the urn was flooded with water.\nDodgson said she fears the disturbance of the plot could result in the collapse of the vaults where her parents' coffins are laid.\nThe family has been in contact with attorneys for a possible breech of contract and gross negligence lawsuit.\n\"There were some mistakes made by prior owners,\" Vitelli said of the Southern Memorial Gardens situation. \"We have to correct those mistakes.\"\nThe attorney added that while aggrieved plot owners have been urged to file suit, \"nobody has filed any action against the cemetery.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Henry, 27, guilty of two drug charges, handing down two 15-year sentences and suspending all but five years of each in a binding agreement. The two fiveyear terms will be served concurrently, according to court documents.Henry's release will be followed by three years of supervised probation.The charges against Henry stemmed from the Easton Police Department's investigation into a fatal overdose late last year.Police were dispatched to the Econo Lodge on Dec. 5, 2022, for an overdose victim.Officers began and continued resuscitation efforts until they were relieved by Talbot County paramedics.The victim was transported to the University of Maryland Shore Medical Center at Easton, where he was later pronounced dead.Detectives with EPD's Criminal Investigations Division conducted the death investigation. After several months, Henry and Iyana Wilson, 27, were identified as the individuals who sold a cocaine and fentanyl mix to the victim, police said.Two cases involving alleged drug possession and distribution remain pending against Wilson.In September, Wilson entered an Alford plea to possession with intent to distribute narcotics in one case. She is set to be sentenced Dec. 15 in Talbot County Circuit Court.A second case charges Wilson with manufacturing narcotics, conspiring with Henry to manufacture drugs, possession of drug paraphernalia and obstructing justice.She is also alleged to have altered physical evidence relevant to a criminal proceeding and to have possessed contraband in a place of confinement by having narcotics inside her body while at the Easton Police Department, according to charging documents.The second case against Wilson is set for a status conference on Dec. 1. \n \n Caption: The Talbot County Circuit Court is located at 11 North Washington St., Easton. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The letter begins, \u201cAs your editor reminds us frequently, the decision to stop hand delivery of the Star Democrat to our homes is perhaps economically necessary and practical to continue bringing local news to our community.\u201d\n\nThe writer complains that these boxes \u201cdo not get prettier with time and will continue to mar our beautiful highways until they are removed,\u201d and calls for a way to unearth and dispose of them \u201cwithout buying tools, hiring someone or hurting ourselves.\u201d The letter stresses that the rusted containers are \u201ctoo rusty and dangerous for service groups or school kids to get service hours.\u201d\n\nThe writer asks, \u201cIf we get them out of the ground, can someone collect them and dispose of them in a responsible way? Too rusty and dangerous for service groups or school kids to get service hours? Let\u2019s come up with a happy resolution for keeping our scenery free of antiquated ugliness, OK?\u201d The letter is signed \u201cSUZANNE\u202fHOOD, Royal Oak\u201d and is published under the *Star Democrat\u2019s* staff writer\u2019s section.",

ShotSpotter alerts fell 33.3% to 46, and shots fired calls fell 40.9% to 13.  The first quarter also had one shooting, confirmed by Todd as occurring on March 1 in the 800 block of Phillips Street.  Police found several spent shell casings from multiple calibers, and Isaiah David Foster, 23, of Cambridge was arrested on firearm possession, resisting arrest, and obstructing and hindering charges.  \n\u201cWe know there's more out there, and we know there's still crime,\u201d Todd said. \u201cBut we're making progress.\u201d\n\nCalls for service rose 9.1% to 171 adult arrests, 8 juvenile arrests, and 34 juvenile referrals, though Todd said the numbers for last year were not available.  He described juvenile crime as \u201cstagnant\u201d and added, \u201cI think there's a lot of work to do with juvenile reform,\u201d continuing, \u201cWe have to put more emphasis on figuring out why these kids are out committing these crimes and getting in touch with families by working through social services and Juvenile Services.\u201d  Todd expects a clearer picture after summer, stating, \u201cWhen the kids get out of school, that'll be a big factor of just how good we're doing crime\u2011wise.\u201d",

Young is charged with first\u2011degree assault, home invasion, reckless endangerment and four firearm charges; Adkins faces two handgun charges, accessory after the fact to a felony, altering physical evidence and making a false statement to an officer.\n\nAround 1:40\u202fp.m. on August\u202f12, police were dispatched to a first\u2011floor room. According to court documents, 58\u2011year\u2011old James Terrell\u202fJr. told police he and Adkins were in the room when Young knocked at the door.

    "content": "Along Route\u202f210 in Bryans Road, a metal cross marks the spot where Tiffani Carrington was killed on Dec.\u202f21,\u202f1996.  The cross reads \u201cTiffani\u201d in large letters, has a red flower at the top, and bears the Bryans Road Volunteer Fire Department and Rescue Squad insignia.  According to Deborah Carrington\u2011Smith, \u201cShe was 19 years old,\u201d and \u201cHer car, a 1987 Nissan 300ZX, was broadsided by a Charles County sheriff\u2019s officer.\u201d  Carrington\u2011Smith added that the 19\u2011year\u2011old \u201cwas a child full of spunk, a teenager wise beyond her years and an EMT with aspirations of becoming a flight paramedic. She was a cheerleader, a softball player, a coach and a mentor to other youth. She was the apple of her father\u2019s eye and a bit bossy with her younger brothers. She had so much love to give and was never stingy with her affection.\u201d  Her mother said, \u201cThis is who Tiffani was to our family,\u201d and described her further: \u201cShe spoke her mind unabashedly, valuing authenticity, honesty and courage.\u201d  \u201cMaterial things were not important to her and she judged people by how they treated others.\u201d\n\nThe state\u2019s rules for roadside memorials are vague.  SHA spokesman Daniel Allman told Southern Maryland News, \u201cState Highway Administration does not track memorials that are placed along state highways in memory of crash victims.\u201d  \u201cHowever, state law prohibits the unauthorized placement of anything along state highways that are not approved, highway safety\u2011related signs or devices.\u201d  \u201cThe placement of roadside memorials could pose safety and maintenance concerns for motorists, pedestrians and highway workers.\u201d  Despite this, many memorials remain on Maryland roads, and the state offers legal alternatives such as the Adopt\u2011a\u2011Highway program and Partnership Plantings.\n\nAnother memorial, at the intersection of Tim\u2019s Place in Nanjemoy, honors 20\u2011year\u2011old Autumn\u202fJenkins, who died in a collision on April\u202f28,\u202f2015.  Katelyn Shannon described the memorial: \u201cThe memorial to her cousin \u2018sits in front of a telephone pole. We have a stone that was engraved with a drawing of a dog and the fire shield. We also have her helmet shield up and we actively put flowers and solar lights. We actively attend DUI checkpoints conducted by the La Plata Police Department in memory of her.\u201d  Jenkins was a volunteer responder and worked at the Charles County Humane Society and a Waldorf pool, and the 0.14 blood\u2011alcohol level of the truck driver was cited in her sentencing.\n\nThe memorials for 27\u2011year\u2011old Lauren\u202fPitt and 55\u2011year\u2011old motorcycle rider Conrado \u201cChico\u201d Fabricante Jr. stand in front of the guardrail on southbound Route\u202f2/4 near Rousby Hall Road.  Jonna Jones remembered Pitt, \u201cHer enthusiasm for people made me feel like I could do anything.\u201d  \u201cSuch a bright, positive person. We lost a bright light when she passed.\u201d  \u201cThis year it will be 10 years, that\u2019s hard to believe,\u201d Jones said.  Jones also noted her participation in a half\u2011marathon to honor Pitt, \u201cIt helped me keep going,\u201d she added.\n\nOther roadside memorials highlight different tragedies.  A cross bearing \u201cJoseph\u201d on Three Notch Road marks the fatal crash of 24\u2011year\u2011old David Joseph Johnson on Oct.\u202f1,\u202f2018; the St.\u202fMary\u2019s County Sheriff\u2019s Office release said his sedan \u201cwent out of control \u2018for unknown reasons.\u2019\u201d  Then\u2011Captain Steve Hall told The Enterprise, \u201cThere\u2019s only one person that knows, and that person can\u2019t tell us.\u201d  \u201cThere\u2019s never any logical explanation.\u201d  Zachary \u201cZack\u201d Spain\u2019s memorial on a utility pole in Prince Frederick is kept in flowers year\u2011long, \u201cI keep flowers all year round attached to the utility pole,\u201d Kandia Spain told Southern Maryland News.  Finally, a small white cross at the Route\u202f5 and Chingville Road intersection commemorates Brysen McKinley Carter, 8, who died in a March\u202f16,\u202f2024 single\u2011vehicle crash; a GoFundMe raised more than $19,000 and a Pax River Raiders tribute wrote, \u201cI miss you every day, Lil Bro.\u201d",

    "date": "2025-02-18",
    "author": "SOfIA APPOLONIO Capital News Service",
    "content": "Lawmakers in Maryland are debating \u201cEric\u2019s ID Law,\u201d a bill that would allow residents to add a notation to their driver\u2019s license or state ID card indicating an invisible disability such as autism or hearing impairment.  If passed, the measure would require law enforcement to receive training on interacting with people who have hidden disabilities and would task the Maryland Motor Vehicle Administration with developing awareness programs.  The proposal aims to protect individuals with invisible disabilities during encounters with first responders, a concern that has been heightened for parents of Black children who may be at higher risk during police interactions.\n\n\u201cThe reality of these encounters presents differently when your Black son transitions to adulthood and becomes a legally independent Black man,\u201d said bill co\u2011sponsor Del. Kym Taylor, a Democrat representing Prince George\u2019s County, who explained that her son has a hidden disability.  \u201cThere are no visible signs nor immediate indicators to help first responders understand potential reactions.\u201d  Named after 20\u2011year\u2011old Eric Blessed Carpenter Grantham, a Black man living with autism, the bill arose after Grantham and his mother Linda feared he might face police encounters that could not accommodate his disability.  Grantham, who designed logos that could be displayed on ID cards, said, \u201cEric\u2019s ID Law was created to help save lives for people who cannot use their own voice.\u201d\n\nPrince George\u2019s County Sheriff John Carr expressed support, stating, \u201cFrom a law enforcement perspective, we want you to know that we are here to serve you and we want this bill to pass.\u201d  He added, \u201cAny time that we\u2019re able to put a citizen at ease during a traffic stop, that is something that helps us interact and keep our community safe.\u201d  Similar initiatives already exist in Maryland, such as the MVA \u201cblue card\u201d and the Ethan Saylor Alliance, which was formed in 2015 to provide additional training for law enforcement after the death of 26\u2011year\u2011old Saylor, who had Down syndrome, in a police altercation at a Frederick movie theater.  If enacted, Maryland would join 11 other states that allow people with disabilities to identify themselves on identification cards.",

    "content": "J.R. Dobson, who grew up around fire houses and joined the Trappe Volunteer Fire Company as a junior cadet in his teens, began working with the Easton Volunteer Fire Department in 2003 and rose through the ranks to become assistant chief. He was elected the department\u2019s chief in December and officially began his new role this month, replacing Sonny Jones after Jones completed a third two\u2011year term. Dobson, a patrol and operations commander at the Talbot County Sheriff's Office who has led \u201cabout 35 deputies across multiple divisions,\u201d said, \u201cI think that I bring a lot of management skills, leadership skills,\u201d adding that his experience will help him at the fire house.\n\n\u201cThere's a lot of tradition here,\u201d Dobson said. \u201cIt's certainly the biggest department in the county. It's got probably the most going on out of all the departments in the county. I think just being here, seeing how this department operates versus a small department. It's a business. And we're all here for free, none of us get paid.\u201d He praised former chief Sonny Jones for his incident\u2011command abilities, noting, \u201cIf there were ever a bad day anybody was having, he's who you would want there. Just the way he kind of rolls through an incident scene. He's been there and done that kind of thing.\u201d Jones, who remains involved with the department, said, \u201cI've known J.R. the entire time that I've been a member of the Easton fire department. J.R. is a first\u2011rate guy. He's a terrific leader. He has many, many qualities which will bode well for him as the chief of the department.\u201d\n\nDobson said the support he has received has been \u201coverwhelming,\u201d and he plans to focus early on several projects: purchasing a utility vehicle for Rails to Trails and wood fires, buying a new engine and updating box\u2011alarm assignments, and implementing new standard operating procedures. At the top of his agenda is recruitment and retention of volunteers. \u201cI think it all starts with recruiting. I think it all starts with retention,\u201d he said. \u201cThose are things that we've done well in the past, although the last year or so we haven't gotten as many members as we would like. And sometimes we'll get members in and they don't realize the commitment.\u201d He added that despite town support, \u201cWe got to get people in here. We've got to get these trucks out. And I think that the way the town's growing, if we don't grow with it, then we're failing ourselves.\u201d",

    "title": "Democratic lawmakers plan to crack down on youth crime in the coming weeks",
    "date": "2024-02-01",
    "author": "STEPH QUINN Capital News Service",
    "content": "On February\u202f1\u202f2024, Governor Wes\u202fMoore, House Speaker Adrienne\u202fJones (D\u2011Baltimore County) and Senate President Bill\u202fFerguson (D\u2011Baltimore City) announced a new set of proposals aimed at tightening Maryland\u2019s youth\u2011justice system. The plan would let Juvenile Services officers route children aged 10\u201113 to a judge if they are accused of \u201cauto thefts and handgun violations\u201d and other newly\u2011added serious offenses. \u201cRight now, juvenile offenders and the services and accountability they need are separated by an abundance of confusion,\u201d said Jones. \u201cEgos, political agendas and arguments over process have filled the gaps.\u201d  \u201cThere must be \u2018accountability for adults in the system, who are charged with administering the system,\u2019\u201d Ferguson said. \u201cWe must ensure that all parts are working to their highest potential.\u201d\n\nThe package, which would be introduced in the legislature over the coming weeks, would expand the 2022 reform law that barred police from charging under\u201113 youth except for the most serious crimes. It would add more offenses to that list, lengthen the maximum probation period a judge can order, and increase the reporting duties of a state agency overseeing youth justice. The announcement was framed as a response to rising numbers of certain youth crimes; although youth violent\u2011crime arrests fell 16.5\u202f% between fiscal years\u202f2020 and\u202f2023, carjackings rose 85.4\u202f% and handgun violations almost 220\u202f% over the same period.\n\nYouth\u2011justice advocates warned that the bill could lead to higher incarceration, especially for Black and brown children. \u201cLegislation introduced today will see thousands more kids incarcerated every year, particularly Black and brown children, and (exacerbate) the already serious racial disparities in Maryland\u2019s juvenile justice system,\u201d the Maryland Youth Justice Coalition wrote in a statement. Republicans have criticized the reform, saying it makes Marylanders less safe and removes services for young people. Yet House Minority Leader Jason\u202fBuckel said the plan shows Democrats are \u201ctaking first steps\u201d to address system flaws. \u201cFor him to be able to step in and say, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m a Democrat. I\u2019m from Baltimore City, but I\u2019m going to step up and say too much is too much and this is a reasonable way to deal with this\u2019 \u2014 it\u2019s incredibly helpful,\u201d Buckel said. He also expressed hope that the governor will persuade fellow Democrats to consider additional tough measures.\n\nThe proposals, if enacted, would build on the state\u2019s 2022 youth\u2011justice reform and seek to bring more clarity and accountability to the treatment of children charged with serious offenses while the Democrats control both legislative chambers and the executive office.",

    "title": "Talbot, Queen Anne's counties included on Trump's list of 'sanctuary jurisdictions'",
    "date": "2025-05-30",
    "author": "Konner Metz",
    "content": "President Donald Trump issued an executive order last month instructing DHS Secretary Kristi Noem to track jurisdictions that the administration considers to be defying the president\u2019s immigration crackdown efforts. On Thursday, the Department of Homeland Security published a list of more than 500 jurisdictions across the country, stating that those jurisdictions are \u201cdefying federal immigration law.\u201d Talbot and Queen Anne\u2019s counties were among the jurisdictions named as \u201csanctuary jurisdictions.\u201d\n\nQueen Anne\u2019s County officials challenged the claim Friday. In a statement, Queen Anne\u2019s County called the sanctuary designation \u201cwholly inaccurate.\u201d \u201cQueen Anne's County has never adopted or endorsed sanctuary policies, nor have we enacted any ordinances or resolutions that would shield individuals in violation of federal immigration law,\u201d the statement read. Talbot County said it received no communication from the federal government that it wasn't complying with federal immigration laws in advance of the list being published. \u201cWe have, and will continue to, follow all applicable federal laws and have not taken any deliberate actions to obstruct their enforcement,\u201d a statement from a Talbot County spokesperson read. \u201cWe welcome further information and guidance from the federal government so we can address any pertinent issues,\u201d the statement added.\n\nThe DHS website states that jurisdictions were designated \u201csanctuary\u201d based on the following factors: \u201ccompliance with federal law enforcement, information restrictions, and legal protections for illegal aliens.\u201d Noem said in a DHS press release about the list of jurisdictions that the department is \u201cexposing these sanctuary politicians who harbor criminal illegal aliens and defy federal law.\u201d \u201cThese sanctuary city politicians are endangering Americans and our law enforcement in order to protect violent criminal illegal aliens,\u201d Noem said.\n\nTalbot County Sheriff Joe Gamble said in an interview Friday he is concerned about the status of a federal grant that goes to the Talbot County Sheriff\u2019s Office. This year, the agency received $40,000 to increase patrol efforts in Trappe, a town without its own police department. The grant \u2014 which is administered annually \u2014 has led to a number of arrests and reduced crime, Gamble said. \u201cWe hope that we can reapply and renew that grant,\u201d he said. \u201cThey haven\u2019t asked us to do anything,\u201d Gamble said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t said no to anything.\u201d\n\nQueen Anne\u2019s County Sheriff Gary Hofmann expressed similar sentiments. \u201cThis is continued misinformation that\u2019s been perpetuated now,\u201d Hofmann said. \u201cI\u2019ve heard this for a couple years, so it\u2019s of no surprise.\u201d Under Trump, Immigration and Customs Enforcement has ramped up agreements with local law\u2011enforcement agencies, referred to as 287(g) agreements, to carry out immigration crackdown efforts. ICE has signed nearly 700 of these agreements nationwide and seven in Maryland. Neither Talbot County nor Queen Anne\u2019s County are currently engaged in 287(g) agreements. Hofmann and Gamble said since the sheriff\u2019s offices aren\u2019t in charge of the counties\u2019 jails, they can\u2019t enter into jail enforcement agreements with ICE like other Maryland counties have. Hofmann noted the Queen Anne\u2019s sheriff\u2019s office was eligible for ICE\u2019s Secure Communities program, a separate and now defunct effort where local agencies submitted fingerprints of those arrested to the federal government. \u201cHasn\u2019t changed on how we deal with criminals,\u201d Hofmann added, emphasizing a \u201czero tolerance\u201d approach.",

The fire caused $175,000 in damage to the structure and $75,000 in lost contents. Smoke alarms were present, but it is unknown whether they were functioning.\n\nA tenant that resided on the first level of the home was able to escape uninjured, according to the fire marshal's office. The bodies of the two deceased men have been transported to the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in Baltimore to determine the cause of death. The Charles County Volunteer Fire and Emergency Medical Services Facebook page reported that there were severe hoarder conditions at the site, evidenced by photographs of items littered throughout the property. An investigation remains ongoing to determine the exact cause of the fire.",

Johnson explained that a spotter\u2019s \u201cmain mission of the spotter is to be aware of the rapidly changing conditions of the weather,\u201d and noted that the county\u2019s last\u2011year reports placed it second most severe thunderstorms, third most tornado warnings, and fourth most flash flood warnings.\n\nShe warned against complacency when a \u201csevere thunderstorm warning\u201d is issued, saying \u201cthat\u2019s a mistake to think one\u2019s worse than the other.\u201d  Johnson also highlighted water as the deadliest weather hazard: \u201cWhen we look at the fatalities, 75% in the United States are due to water in some way; 50% of those are due to storm surge; 25% freshwater heavy rain flooding. Keep that in mind. Don\u2019t think, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s just a tropical storm.\u2019 No, you still need to pay attention and see what the hazards are.\u201d\n\nJohnson explained the difference between a watch and a warning\u2014\u201cA watch means to keep an eye on the weather pattern. A warning means, don\u2019t just watch \u2014 get prepared\u201d\u2014and urged attendees to understand that even a category\u202f1 hurricane can spawn tornadoes.  She cited Hurricane\u202fIda and Hurricane\u202fIsaias as examples that produced significant tornado activity and reminded listeners that \u201ctornados hit everywhere, even in our backyard,\u201d adding that \u201cthat\u2019s why we need you all,\u201d when urging them to report observations to the nearest NWS station.\n\nShe encouraged adults, especially those affiliated with hospitals, schools, churches, and nursing homes, to enroll in the SKYWARN training and join a volunteer network of 350,000\u2013400,000 spotters.  Johnson emphasized the value of the role, quoting the NWS: \u201cThere can be no finer reward than to know that your efforts have given your family and neighbors the precious gift of time\u2014minutes that can help save lives.\u201d  She capped the session with a joke about the upcoming film \u201cTwisters\u201d and a call to become \u201cinformed citizens who save lives\u201d rather than sensationalist storm chasers.",

    "content": "Lawmakers in Annapolis recently passed a series of statutes that now allow juveniles under 13 to be exempt from criminal charges unless the offense is violent. \u201cthe age now for a juvenile to 'not be charged with any crime is under 10 years old.'\u201d The new rules also bar any non\u2011violent crimes\u2014including theft, burglary, vandalism, drug dealing, and even simple assault\u2014from being charged against juveniles under 13, regardless of the severity of the act. \u201cIf you can think of a crime, and it is not a crime of violence then they cannot be charged period.\u201d  \n\nThe policy changes have already led to high\u2011profile incidents. In Dorchester County a 9\u2011year\u2011old stole 11 motor vehicles and was released without charges; another juvenile with a loaded handgun faced no prosecution. In Wicomico County a 12\u2011year\u2011old assaulted a teacher and was likewise not charged because the act was classified as simple assault. \u201cIf your property is lost, damaged or destroyed you will have to sue their parents since there will now be no court hearing for the parents to be ordered to give you restitution.\u201d The law also bars police from questioning any minor under 18 without an attorney present, and \u201cEven if they tell the police who they were carrying the drugs or guns for it may not be able to be used in court against the adult if the juvenile did not have an attorney present there for them.\u201d  \n\nThe author, Thomas R. Hurley, president of the Cambridge\u2011Dorchester Lodge of the Fraternal Order of Police, warns that the new law could enable \u201cthe very worst case is where a juvenile under the age of 10 murders or kills someone, and they cannot be charged.\u201d He calls the legislation \u201ca step that will raise children to be \u2018career criminals\u2019 because they will learn that nothing will happen to them and even into their adulthood.\u201d \u201cIf a 9\u2011year\u2011old commits murder they get counseling.\u201d  \n\nHurley urges residents to contact state and local legislators to reverse the statutes, noting that the next legislative session will not convene until January 2024. \u201cWe all must make Annapolis reverse what it has done and see that we are causing our children to grow up without any morals.\u201d He adds, \u201cI never thought that we would see this on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, but it has come here now and found us and now is not the time to be silent.\u201d",

    "content": "A $235,000 settlement approved by the Board of Public Works on November\u202f9,\u202f2023 resolved all claims in a federal lawsuit that the family of 19\u2011year\u2011old Anton\u202fBlack filed against the state medical examiner for his death in Greensboro in 2018.  The payment to the family amounts to $100,000, while $135,000 will cover attorneys\u2019 fees, and the settlement was approved without discussion during the Wednesday meeting.  It also \u201cmakes necessary changes to the Maryland Office of the Chief Medical Examiner's process for autopsies conducted on people killed in law enforcement custody and requires notification to families about the results and their rights to challenge the results,\u201d according to a news release from the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\nThe reforms adopted by the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner will adopt a policy addressing deaths in custody, model guidelines from the National Association of Medical Examiners, and require families to be informed of their rights to seek correction of an autopsy report.  \u201cWe can\u2019t prevent such deaths if we aren\u2019t honest about what caused them, and this settlement is a crucial step towards that goal in future cases,\u201d said Sonia\u202fKumar, a senior staff attorney with the ACLU of Maryland.  She added, \u201cWe hope this settlement will make a real, positive impact, but it is truly just the beginning of the reckoning needed to address decades of misrepresentations so we can bring justice to families still waiting for the government to tell the truth.\u201d\n\nRichard\u202fPotter, the founder of the Coalition for Justice for Anton\u202fBlack, called the settlement an \u201cexcellent first step,\u201d adding that community members must stay vigilant to ensure it is effective and increases accountability from within.  \u201cI hope that with this settlement agencies will begin to recognize their own wrongdoings, catch them and change them before they cause harm,\u201d he said in the statement.  \u201cWhat is needed is a sense of shared ownership that can only come through trust and mutual accountability, with police confronting their own biases about mental illness, committing to de\u2011escalation, and truly serving a diverse community.\u201d\n\nBlack was on his mother\u2019s front steps on September\u202f15,\u202f2018, when he was chased, tased and restrained by three white police officers and a white civilian.  He was dragged by a 12\u2011year\u2011old family friend and then, after being pressed against a wooden handicap ramp for six minutes, became unresponsive.  Officers performed CPR, transported him to the University of Maryland Shore Medical Center in Easton, where he was pronounced dead that evening.  The medical examiner ruled the death an accident caused by a heart condition, with bipolar disorder as a contributing cause.  The family\u2019s December\u202f2020 wrongful\u2011death lawsuit against police, towns and the medical examiner was unresolved until a 2022 settlement that required police departments in Greensboro, Ridgely and Centreville to overhaul use\u2011of\u2011force policies, enhance resources for mental\u2011health emergencies, and provide a $5\u202fmillion payment to the family.  Anton\u2019s Law, passed in 2021, was a result of these efforts, making police discipline records publicly available under Maryland\u2019s Public Information Act.",

    "content": "Denton \u2013 At the September 2, 2025 meeting of the Caroline County Commissioners, County Administrator Kathleen\u202fFreeman reported a recent discussion with Queen Anne\u2019s County about whether Caroline County would join a three\u2011county plan for a new 388\u2011bed regional detention center. The proposed facility would be built at the former Eastern Pre\u2011Release Unit site at 700\u202fFlat\u202fIron\u202fSquare\u202fRoad near Church Hill to address the region\u2019s need for modern, efficient detention spaces.\n\nCommissioner\u202fTravis\u202fBreeding voiced the county\u2019s main objection. \u201cUnfortunately, because of their schedule and their pay scale, I don't think Caroline County is going to save any money by entering into the agreement,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we're not going to save any money, why relinquish the autonomy that we have right now to operate as our own facility and better suit the needs of the Caroline County as opposed to a three\u2011county organization. I just don't see the upside at this point.\u201d He added, \u201cWe did our due diligence, we looked into it, it's just not going to work.\u201d\n\nThe draft agreement would have placed majority authority in Queen Anne\u2019s County: \u201cThe Board shall appoint a Warden to operate the Facility with the consent of the County Commissioners of Queen Anne\u2019s County.\u201d The Warden\u2019s contract \u201cshall not be terminated without the Board's consent.\u201d Commissioners were concerned that, under the draft, Queen Anne\u2019s County could unilaterally remove Caroline or Kent from the agreement after a two\u2011year notice period, and that the proposed regional authority to manage the center had not been mentioned originally.\n\n\u201c We appreciate the time and the effort that Kent, Queen Anne\u2019s and our staff have put into researching this, we did our due diligence, and we just don't feel that it's going to be advantageous for us to enter into the three\u2011county agreement,\u201d Breeding said, adding, \u201cWe went through the process, and in theory it looked like it should have been a good deal for Caroline County, but it just hasn't worked out that way.\u201d\n\nAlthough the county has not ruled out a regional facility outright, the commissioners are leaning toward withdrawing from the current agreement and concentrating on upgrades to the existing county\u2011owned detention center.",

    "content": "Videos of a Tuesday afternoon assault at Easton High School have been circulating online. Three students and one staff member were involved, and the incident lasted about 30 seconds before other staff members intervened to separate the students and defuse the situation. According to the Talbot County Sheriff's Office press release, two victims were identified\u2014one an Easton High School staff member and the second a student\u2014and no identities have yet been released. The assault led to one student being transported to the University of Maryland Shore Medical Center at Easton via Talbot County Department of Emergency Services for non\u2011life\u2011threatening injuries, and the two other students in the video were identified and arrested.\n\nIn the video, a student in a black hoodie approaches a student in a red hoodie and assaults him; the red\u2011hoodied student falls to the floor. An additional student in a gray hoodie then joins in the assault. A male staff member in a white shirt attempts to protect the assaulted student and physically places his body on top of the student, seemingly acting as a barrier. The two other students continue to assault both the student in red and the staff member before other staff members intervene. The incident is currently under investigation.\n\nAccording to a statement from Debbie Gardner, director of communications for Talbot County Public Schools, the event is being evaluated and those involved will face appropriate disciplinary action. \u201cThe safety of our students and staff is always our top priority. We are grateful for our partnership with the Talbot County Sheriff's Office and the presence of School Resource Officers in our schools,\u201d the statement said. \u201cDeputy Horseman, along with several other Sheriff\u2019s deputies and members of the Easton High staff responded quickly to contain the incident. The students involved will face appropriate disciplinary action, and we are continuously evaluating safety measures to prevent or mitigate incidents of this nature.\u201d",

    "content": "The Centreville Town Council announced on Aug.\u202f7 that the old mill at 2647 Centreville Road will be demolished because it is a \u201cdangerous building that poses a risk to public safety.\u201d  The council gave the property owner ten days from that meeting to remove the structure, warning that \u201cin the event of failing to do so, the town may cause the structure to be demolished.\u201d\n\nTo enforce the demolition, the council unanimously approved a new town\u2011code chapter that authorizes an administrative search warrant for dangerous buildings.  State law requires such a chapter to obtain a judge\u2019s warrant; the town will then need a court order before entering the property, \u201cto allow inspectors onto property the town deems pose a public safety risk.\u201d  The ordinance\u2019s initial draft \u201creceived considerable public outcry but no public comment was presented at the hearing.\u201d  Council President Ashley Kaiser said, \u201cSo that feels like a good sign,\u201d and added, \u201cI think it is a step in the right direction and puts us in line with a lot of towns around us.\u201d\n\nIn other business, the council noted three applications have been received for the two chairs open in the upcoming October election; the Ethics Board will review them before the Board of Supervisors of Elections considers them.  Although on the ballot for re\u2011election, Council Member Jim\u202fBeauchamp said he intended to withdraw if both other candidates move forward, noting \u201cIt\u2019s been a good 10 years.\u201d  The Centreville Town Council will next meet on Sept.\u202f4 at 7\u202fp.m.",

    "content": "After\u2011school activities were canceled across the region because a powerful storm system was forecast to bring heavy rain, strong winds, and flooding on Tuesday, 8\u202fJanuary\u202f2024.  Dorchester County Public Schools operated on a half\u2011day dismissal schedule Tuesday and all county schools were set to run on a two\u2011hour delay Wednesday, Jan.\u202f10, while Queen Anne's County Public Schools also dismissed early Tuesday and were slated for a 90\u2011minute delay Wednesday.  Schools in Talbot and Caroline counties canceled all after\u2011school activities Tuesday and were monitoring conditions to decide whether to delay or close on Wednesday.  The Caroline County Board of Education meeting was held at 6\u202fp.m. Tuesday as scheduled.  Gov. Wes\u202fMoore declared a State of Preparedness on Tuesday morning, directing the state\u2019s Department of Emergency Management to coordinate responses to the storm\u2019s impacts.\n\nA coastal flood warning was issued from 7\u202fp.m. Tuesday to 7\u202fp.m. Wednesday for lower Chesapeake Bay areas, including Cambridge, where \u201cwater is expected be two to three feet above ground level in some low\u2011lying areas.\u201d  A flood watch and a coastal flood warning were also in effect for Talbot, Caroline, Queen Anne\u2019s and Kent counties from Tuesday afternoon through Wednesday morning.  The National Weather Service predicted \u201crainfall of 1 to 3 inches is possible across the region Tuesday, with the heaviest rain expected Tuesday night before tapering off Wednesday morning.\u201d  The main concern, said Mike Lee, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service\u2019s Philadelphia/Mount Holly office, is the potential for coastal flooding in Talbot and Queen Anne\u2019s counties, while Dorchester County was also expected to experience significant flooding.\n\nWind warnings were in place for the region: Dorchester County was under a high wind warning from 4\u202fp.m. Tuesday to 4\u202fa.m. Wednesday, with south\u2011to\u2011southeast winds of 30\u201140\u202fmph and gusts up to 60\u202fmph possible.  Talbot, Caroline, Kent and Queen Anne\u2019s counties had a wind advisory from 5\u202fp.m. Tuesday to 3\u202fa.m. Wednesday, with sustained winds of 25\u201135\u202fmph and gusts up to 55\u202fmph.  The already\u2011saturated ground made trees more vulnerable to becoming uprooted, and the Talbot County Department of Emergency Services urged residents to secure loose items and not drive through or stand in flooded roadways.\n\nThe Weather Service noted that the region would dry out some on Thursday, but a second storm is likely to roll through again Friday night into Saturday.  The story has been updated to include information on school delays and closures and may be updated further.",

    "title": "Caroline Police Accountability Board reports progress",
    "date": "2024-02-14",
    "author": "Connie Connolly",
    "content": "The Caroline County Police Accountability Board presented its second annual report to the County Commissioners on Feb.\u202f6, 2024.  Board chairman John\u202fBartlett opened by noting that the Sheriff's Office logged more than 26,000 calls for service in 2023 but received only six complaints.  \u201cFive of those six were exonerated, meaning unfounded, and one was a very minor infraction, which led to a written reprimand,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that speaks volumes with law enforcement here in Caroline County.\u201d\n\nThe report explained the three\u2011board structure mandated by the Maryland Police Accountability Act of 2021.  \u201cThe role of the county's Police Accountability Board is to receive police complaints, recommend policy changes and identify any trends,\u201d Raeder said. \u201cThe second board is the five\u2011member Administrative Charging Committee, and their role is to look over and review completed complaint investigations and recommend discipline,\u201d she added. \u201cIf the Charging Committee decides to administratively charge, they use the statewide police disciplinary matrix to decide what kind of discipline would be necessary based on the complaint.\u201d  No complaints have been referred to the Trial Board, which is comprised of retired Judge Owen\u202fWise, a citizen, and a police officer. \u201cI'm proud to say that Caroline County is leading the way for other counties on the Eastern Shore who have reached out to us regarding using Judge Wise, if they need a judge for a trial board,\u201d Raeder said.\n\nOf the 15 complaints filed by the county\u2019s municipalities, four are pending investigation, three were administratively charged, two were withdrawn by the complainant, four were exonerated and two were \u201cnot in the purview of the ACC (Administrative Charging Committee).\u201d  The only incident that gained widespread attention was a 7\u202fApril 2023 event in Denton, where a video showed Christopher\u202fMorgan threatening residents and breaking a storm\u2011door window while two police officers watched.  The handling of that call prompted Denton Police Chief George\u202fBacorn to request a Talbot County investigation, the findings of which were turned over to the Administrative Charging Committee.  A recurring trend identified in completed investigations was the lack of body\u2011camera activation during public interactions: \u201cA common identified trend, however, has been the lack of activation of body cameras when officers interact with the public,\u201d the report stated.  \u201cLegal Counsel attends each quarterly meeting and provides interpretation of the Maryland Police Accountability Act of 2021 as needed,\u201d the report added.\n\nThe board recommends several changes, including shifting all ACC training to online or pre\u2011recorded formats.  \u201cThe Accountability Board recommends \u2018changing ACC training from all in-person training to online meeting based or pre\u2011recorded online training. With one member of our ACC board resigning this past July, we have firsthand knowledge of the burden imposed on the newly appointed volunteer Board member. As terms end or resignations occur, the pool of applicants will continue to shrink when advised that members must undergo uncompensated training prior to serving.\u2019\u201d  It also suggests amending the law to limit Charging Committee referrals to \u201cmatters of public concern,\u201d such as \u201cpolice misconduct, such as abuse of power, false arrest, police brutality, or criminal activity,\u201d and to handle \u201crude and discourteous\u201d behavior at the department level.  \u201cThe Accountability Board identified trends in the disciplinary process and didn\u2019t \u2018recommend any changes at this time.\u2019\u201d  The report details that $105,272 in grant funds was received, $49,545 spent (on software, licensing and the administrator), and nearly $8,000 was allocated for external legal counsel, with legal expenses of $3,650 for the PAB and $4,300 for the ACC.",

The event featured appetizers, drinks, and a presentation by author and speaker Frank\u202fKros, who discussed the lasting impact of positive influences on children who have experienced abuse.  \n\nDuring the reception, Executive Director Robin\u202fDavenport opened the evening by saying, \u201cThe people who bring our mission to life are our CASA volunteers,\u201d and later added, \u201cAnd so we're here tonight because everyone in this room talks the talk and walks the walk,\u201d Davenport said. \u201cAnd that is really important to us, but certainly to the future of the kids who we're working with.\u201d Davenport recounted the story of a retired volunteer named Sally, who recently learned that a nurse\u2014once a case she had advocated for a decade earlier\u2014had finished high school and college \u201cbecause of what Sally said to her.\u201d  \n\nVolunteer Geoff\u202fSearle, who began volunteering in 2022 after retirement, noted that social workers often face large caseloads, whereas CASA volunteers can focus on a single child. Larry\u202fNeviaser, a new volunteer this year, explained that the organization\u2019s dedication to each child\u2019s best outcome drew him in. He said, \u201cWe don't represent anybody else except the child,\u201d he said. Neviaser also added, \u201cThey recognize the value of the volunteers, and (that) it really makes the organization,\u201d he said.  \n\nKros\u2019s talk highlighted the mindset of abused children and offered practical tips for encouragement. He concluded, \u201cIt\u2019s incredible what we can do when someone genuinely believes in us and provides us the support that we need,\u201d he said. The evening celebrated the work of volunteers who assign court\u2011appointed special advocates in Dorchester, Kent, Queen Anne\u2019s, and Talbot counties to support children at significant risk in their homes.",

    "date": "2024-03-19",
    "author": "SAPNA BANSIL Capital News Service",
    "content": "A Brotherhood Against Totalitarian Enactments (ABATE), a motorcycle\u2011rights group founded in 1974, meets Maryland lawmakers every Monday in an attempt to make the state\u2019s 1992 helmet law optional for riders over 21 who have held a license for at least two years and completed a safety course. The proposed bill, named the Gary \u201cPappy\u201d Boward Act, has been introduced in every legislative session for 32 years, but it has never passed. \u201cIt\u2019s been 32 years this year to no avail,\u201d Bob Spanburgh, Maryland ABATE\u2019s board chairman, said. \u201cBut we keep introducing it. We have some pretty ardent supporters. We have a lot of people who think we\u2019re nuts, probably.\u201d\n\nSen. Mike McKay, the bill\u2019s primary Senate sponsor and a friend of the late Boward, argues that the government should educate rather than mandate helmet use. \u201cI firmly believe that we as government do better when we educate people, [rather] than legislating something,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are people that would like to have the choice [to not wear a helmet.] And I tend to believe that we should give people the choice but 100% support educating them about it.\u201d\n\nSpanburgh, a 66\u2011year\u2011old retired carpenter, joined ABATE in the mid\u20111980s and was first exposed to politics through the organization. \u201cAt the first meeting I went to, the thing they told me [was,] \u2018You got to register to vote. It\u2019s very important in this organization,\u2019\u201d he recalled. \u201cThat was actually the first time I ever registered to vote in my life. I was 27 at the time.\u201d\n\nThe bill has bipartisan sponsors: Sen. Jill Carter (D\u2011Baltimore City) co\u2011sponsors it in the Senate. \u201cI don\u2019t agree with them that they shouldn\u2019t wear a helmet, but I do agree about the civil liberty issue,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are adamant as dedicated motorcyclists that this is not something they want mandated to them,\u201d she added. Opposition from highway safety groups, medical associations and public health officials is strong. \u201cA lot of people might say, \u2018Well, it\u2019s my free will to do whatever I want to do, no matter how stupid it is,\u2019\u201d Gene Ransom, CEO of MedChi, the Maryland State Medical Society, said in an interview. \u201cThe problem is, when it comes to healthcare \u2026 your decision then ends up costing the entire system a whole lot of money.\u201d \u201cNot only is it the right thing to do and the smart thing to do \u2014 logical people wear helmets when they ride a motorcycle or a bike or other things \u2014 it also is appropriate from a common good and cost point of view,\u201d Ransom added. Del. Jay Jacobs (R\u2011Caroline, Cecil, Kent, Queen Anne\u2019s) praised the persistence of ABATE\u2019s members, saying, \u201cThey\u2019re diehards for what they believe in. Thank God they do. They don\u2019t let go of this stuff. It\u2019s a tough fight over here to get that kind of legislation passed.\u201d\n\nThe bill, cross\u2011filed as HB639 and SB503, is scheduled for a hearing before the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee later this week. Spanburgh hopes it will advance beyond committee and reach a floor vote. \u201cIf I don\u2019t do it, who else is going to do it?\u201d said Ken Eaton, Maryland ABATE\u2019s executive director. \u201cWe try to get other people to help us as much as possible. But if I don\u2019t do it, how can I convince other people to do it?\u201d",

We gave them information. We gave them data.\u201d  \n\nCouncil President Chuck Callahan noted the timing of the new station as \u201ckind of the perfect storm here when it comes to having safety, kids.\u201d \u201cIt makes the whole community feel a little bit safer,\u201d he said, referring to concurrent renovations at the elementary school across the street. Fire and rescue leader Jimmy Eason welcomed the facility \u201cwith open arms.\u201d \u201cUnfortunately for us in Cordova, we're facing almost a 100% failure to respond rate,\u201d Eason said. \u201cBut not to any fault of anybody's, it's just a sign of the times. So this station means so much more to this area than some people might believe.\u201d  \n\nCallahan thanked the Gannon family for donating a parcel of their farmland to support the project, and LeCates praised the Gannons\u2019 long\u2011time commitment to county EMS. \u201cEvery step of the way, she always stepped up and tried to help us,\u201d LeCates said of former Council member Sylvia Gannon, a founding member of the Talbot Paramedic Foundation.",

The Safe Boating Campaign, led by the National Safe Boating Council, provides practical tips for practicing social distancing and safety while boating.  \n\nKey recommendations include: wear a U.S. Coast Guard\u2011approved life jacket that fits properly, know state\u2011specific boating laws to avoid fines or jail time, and take a boating safety course. \u201cMake sure your boat is prepared,\u201d the campaign advises, recommending a vessel safety check with the local U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary or U.S. Power Squadrons\u2014each check is free. A float plan should be filed before leaving shore with details about the trip, boat, crew, towing or trailer vehicle, communication equipment, and emergency contacts.  \n\nBoaters should also check weather conditions and water temperature, avoid alcohol because it is a leading factor in boating\u2011related deaths, and prevent carbon monoxide poisoning by installing a working CO detector, keeping exhaust outlets unobstructed, and staying at least 20 feet from other running engines or generators. Maintaining at least two reliable communication devices such as satellite phones, VHF radios, or personal locator beacons is essential for emergencies. By following these guidelines, boaters can enjoy the water responsibly and safely.",

We\u2019re really trying to eliminate the stigmas associated with mental health saying that its OK to ask for help.\u201d  The program will begin in early 2024 with a new coordinator and six officers ready to discuss job stressors.  \u201cIt\u2019s all about affecting a new culture within an organization that it is OK to say you are not ok,\u201d Rainey said.  \u201cIt\u2019s challenging to put on a police uniform and feel or just assume there is just disdain for you just as a result of your profession,\u201d he added, stressing that \u201cIndividuals know in their own hearts that the great majority of police get involved because they want to help people.\u201d\n\nWyoming\u2019s Laramie County Sheriff Brian\u202fKozak highlighted staffing shortages and the toll on morale.  \u201cThe pressures of the job from working so many hours are catching up to them,\u201d he said.  \u201cJust a few weeks ago, we had a deputy who was stabbed.\u201d  His agency now has 220 employees with only 20 openings, down from 70 at the time of his election.  Kozak noted his department works with a psychiatrist for debriefing after traumatic incidents and keeps counseling visits anonymous.  \u201cWe\u2019re looking to expand that,\u201d he said, as the county also includes the fire department in its eight\u2011person peer\u2011support team.  In Wisconsin, the Eau Claire Community Foundation\u2019s new fund reimburses officers for mental\u2011health costs not covered by insurance; \u201cThe fund was recently established to reimburse local law enforcement personnel for mental health expenses not covered by their health insurance; grants will be paid directly to the Eau Claire County Sheriff\u2019s Department (since we can\u2019t make grants to individuals) and applied to their requests for reimbursement,\u201d said Rebecca White Body.  Capt. John Bollinger of the Talbot County Sheriff\u2019s Office, an \u201cold school\u201d commander of 43 years, said, \u201cfrequent reminders that seeking help is not a sign of weakness.\u201d  He added, \u201cToo many citizens nationwide believe police officers are generally bad people,\u201d and that negative media portrayals after incidents such as the death of George\u202fFloyd \u201ctake a toll on officers\u2019 morale and wellness.\u201d",

    "content": "Jeffrey Allen Lander, 41, was sentenced on Tuesday to eight years in a Maryland Department of Corrections prison for the crossbow\u2011related death of his 45\u2011year\u2011old girlfriend, Judy Elizabeth Gee.  The sentence was imposed by Cecil County Circuit Court Administrative Judge Brenda A. Sexton after a jury had convicted him of involuntary manslaughter and reckless endangerment and acquitted him of second\u2011degree murder, first\u2011degree assault, and second\u2011degree assault.  Lander had been arrested on June 28, six months after the incident, and received credit for roughly seven months he had spent in jail.\n\nGee was shot through the back with a crossbow arrow inside the couple\u2019s home on the 700 block of Bell Manor Road at about 4:40\u202fp.m. on Jan.\u202f14, 2024.  She was transported to Lancaster General Hospital in Lancaster, Pa., where she died on an operating table at 7:13\u202fp.m., about two and a half hours later.  Lander told investigators that \u201cShe was kicking me in the knee. It was a rude awakening. I woke up angry\u201d before he claimed he tripped over a cat and accidentally fired the arrow while preparing to go deer hunting that afternoon.  In a later police interview, however, he denied that an argument had taken place just before the fatal shooting.\n\nDuring the three\u2011day trial in November, Sentman maintained that the shooting was intentional, citing Gee\u2019s disclosure that she was ending their two\u2011year relationship and would leave him.  Lander\u2019s lawyer, Assistant Public Defender Jason Ricke, argued in the jury\u2019s opening statement that the incident was \u201ca tragic accident \u2014 nothing more. It is not a murder. It is not a crime.\u201d  The jury deliberated for approximately four hours before finding Lander guilty of involuntary manslaughter and reckless endangerment and, in the same judgment, acquitteding him of the more serious charges.  The jury\u2019s verdict reflects a distinction between an accidental death caused by gross negligence and a deliberate killing.\n\nSexton remarked from the bench Tuesday that Lander's \u201cconduct was heinous\u201d and agreed with Sentman that Lander exhibited a \u201clack of remorse or acceptance of responsibility for Gee\u2019s death.\u201d  Sentman had recommended a maximum 10\u2011year sentence, exceeding state guidelines that set a range of three to eight years for an active incarceration term.  Lander\u2019s lawyer requested a sentence at the lower end of the guideline range.  The judge imposed the maximum 10\u2011year penalty allowed for involuntary manslaughter, which Lander must serve, effectively merging his reckless endangerment conviction into that sentence.",

The county funded the equipment at a recent Fire Chiefs Committee meeting so that each station can use it after staff are trained, eliminating the need for paid external services and reducing overall testing costs.  \n\nThe AeroFit system will be available at all fire stations and for other emergency personnel, providing a flexible, on\u2011site solution that strengthens readiness across the county. \u201cProviding our firefighters with the right tools is critical,\u201d stated Jimmy Eason, President of the Talbot County Volunteer Fire & Rescue Association. \u201cWith the county's support, this system ensures that every responder, whether volunteer, law enforcement, or emergency services staff, can be confident their protective equipment will keep them safe.\u201d  \n\nThe purchase is part of Talbot County\u2019s ongoing investment in the safety of residents and first responders. Each year the county allocates funds for the seven volunteer fire companies through its annual budget appropriation, distributed by the Talbot County Volunteer Fire and Rescue Association. \u201cThis is about taking care of the people who take care of us,\u201d said council President Chuck Callahan.",

    "content": "Donald Raymond\u202fSnyder Jr., 41, pulled a 9\u202fmm handgun from his waistband at about 9:20\u202fp.m. on June\u202f17 and fired two shots from close range into the upper torso of his friend Christopher\u202fCimorose, 55, who was sitting in the driver's seat of a red Nissan\u202fVersa. Snyder and his defense argued that he acted in self\u2011defense after Cimorose threatened, \u201cI'm going to kill you, (expletive)\u201d while a \u201cmetal pipe\u201d rested on his lap. The prosecution contended that the killing was premeditated because Snyder\u2019s girlfriend, Michelle\u202fMcCarthy, was ending their relationship and that Cimorose, her former boyfriend, had come to pick her up at McCarthy\u2019s request.\n\nDuring a two\u2011day trial, the jury heard state\u2011sponsored footage that began with Snyder \u201cbriskly walking up\u201d to the driver\u2019s side door and punching Cimorose in the face, according to State\u2019s Attorney James\u202fDellmyer. Dellmyer told the jury, \u201cThirteen seconds, in real time, you are going to see the intentional, premeditated killing of Mr. Cimorose,\u201d and added, \u201cChris (Cimorose) didn\u2019t stand a chance. That gun was on him before he got out of the car.\u201d He further warned, \u201cYou cannot start a fistfight and then shoot someone to death,\u201d before asking, \u201cIs it reasonable to use deadly force?\u201d The prosecution also presented evidence of a bruised right hand and an abrasion on Cimorose\u2019s forehead to support a claim of intentional violence.\n\nMcCarthy testified that she had called Cimorose for a ride after her packed car lacked valid license plates. She said, \u201cI said, \u2018That\u2019s it. I\u2019m done with you . . . I packed all my stuff in the car,\u2019\u201d and added, \u201cI saw the punch. I saw everything.\u201d However, her defense attorney, Joshua\u202fInsley, contended she was not credible and noted that she had not mentioned Snyder\u2019s punch in her first interview. Insley cross\u2011examined her, asking, \u201cEver smoke crack before?\u201d and then remarked, \u201cI heard it makes you pretty wacky.\u201d He also highlighted that the autopsy found methadone, cocaine, fentanyl, and other drugs in Cimorose\u2019s system and that the alleged \u201cmetal pipe\u201d could be a club rather than a weapon, accusing investigators of \u201csugar\u2011coating\u201d the description.\n\nAfter about four hours of deliberations, the jury acquitted Snyder of first\u2011degree murder, second\u2011degree murder, voluntary manslaughter, and the eight related charges on Thursday, December\u202f6, 2024. As the forelady announced the verdicts, Snyder lowered his head and appeared emotional beside his lawyer, Joshua\u202fInsley, at the defense table. He was released from the Cecil County Detention Center the same day; he had been held without bond since his June\u202f20 arrest. Maryland State Police, who had initially declined to charge him after an early interview, had charged him after viewing security\u2011camera footage and re\u2011interviewing McCarthy. The case remains a focal point for discussions of self\u2011defense and the use of deadly force in the state.",

    "content": "On Sunday afternoon at the Presbyterian Church of Chestertown, the Samaritan Group of Kent County held a fundraising rally that brought the group to $1,400 toward its $14,000 goal for opening an Emergency Winter Shelter for the first time in December.  \u201cLet\u2019s make this month a recruiting month. Help us do it because I think we certainly can. We\u2019re excited to be able to add December and maybe next year, add another month,\u201d Rev. James Diggs told attendees.  After a $5,000 donation from Christ First United Methodist Church and other gifts, the group ended the event with $12,000, just short of its target.\n\nDiggs emphasized that the shelter\u2019s success depends on both money and people.  \u201cThe number of people we serve is unpredictable. We just don\u2019t know from year to year. The point is to be ready and all of you volunteers make that possible,\u201d he said.  He explained that hosts greet guests, keep them comfortable, and stay from 5:30\u201310\u202fp.m., while sleepers remain through the night.  \u201cThey may not be here, but they were when it counted,\u201d joked Diggs.  \u201cWe are a community and I hope to see some of you as hosts,\u201d Melanie Keller added, noting her two children also volunteer.  \u201cWe need your help,\u201d Diggs said to the community. \u201cWith it we can open up in December\u2026one month at a time.\u201d\n\nDuring the event, the group celebrated volunteers who have made the shelter possible.  Annie Woodall and Andrea Nieman received the Laverne and Shirley Award; Marcia Stoltzfus and family provided soft\u2011serve ice cream; Allison Brieske earned the Host with the Most award; and Anne\u2011Marie Walters was named Volunteer of the Year.  Diggs noted the shelter\u2019s past impact, citing \u201cin the early winter months of 2025, we served 21 clients, seven women, two children and 12 men, 661 bed nights total. In 2018 we served 21 people as well, 1,033 bed nights and that next year, 28 people and 921 bed nights.\u201d\n\nThe Samaritan Group partners with the Mid\u2011Shore Community Foundation, United Way of Kent County, the Good Neighbor Fund and Kent County Department of Social Services.

    "content": "The state attorney general\u2019s office released a 70\u2011page audit on Thursday, May\u202f16, 2025, concluding that Anton Black\u2019s 2018 death in Greensboro should have been ruled homicide.  The report examined 87 cases investigated by former Medical Examiner Dr. David\u202fFowler between 2003 and 2019, reclassifying the cause of death from accidental, unknown or natural to homicide in 36 of them, including Black\u2019s.  Black, 19, was handcuffed and shackled by Greensboro Police Officer Thomas Webster\u202fIV, off\u2011duty Ridgely Police Chief Gary Manos, Centreville Police Officer Dennis\u202fLannon, and a civilian; he was pinned against a wooden handicap ramp for six minutes.  After he stopped breathing, he was taken to the University of Maryland Shore Medical Center in Easton and pronounced dead that evening.  Fowler had originally ruled his death a sudden cardiac event, but a later Johns\u202fHopkins cardiologist concluded asphyxiation was the cause.\n\n\u201cThe audit also validated concerns that bias may have affected death investigations in Maryland,\u201d Attorney General Anthony Brown said in a letter to Marylanders included with the report.  \u201cAddressing those concerns benefits everyone in our system of justice \u2014 including the vast majority of law enforcement professionals who perform their duties with integrity and deserve clear, consistent standards.\u201d  Gov. Wes\u202fMoore wrote, \u201cThis audit marks the beginning of a long conversation \u2014 one that must be handled with honesty, delicacy, resolve, and deep consideration,\u201d and highlighted reforms underway in the medical examiner\u2019s office that have been in progress for several years.\n\nThe audit was led by Towson University psychology professor Jeff\u202fKukucka and began in 2021 after Dr. Fowler\u2019s testimony in the Derek\u202fChauvin trial, in which Fowler cited \u201cexcited delirium\u201d as a possible cause of death, a term that over 450 medical experts had condemned.  The 2023 settlement of a lawsuit by the Coalition for Justice for Anton Black and his family required policy changes for deaths in custody, incorporating guidelines from the National Association of Medical Examiners.  \u201cThis 70\u2011page independent report vindicates what family members and communities \u2014 mostly Black and Brown Marylanders \u2014 have been saying for decades: the truth.  That the entire system has been complicit in making police\u2011involved deaths seem inevitable,\u201d said ACLU of Maryland senior staff attorney Sonia\u202fKumar in a statement Friday.\n\nAn executive order issued by Governor Moore on the same day called for the attorney general\u2019s office and the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office to examine whether any cases should be reopened based on the audit\u2019s findings and established a task force to review the handling of in\u2011custody deaths.  The audit thus marks a potential turning point for Maryland\u2019s death\u2011investigation procedures and the broader conversation about bias and transparency in police\u2011involved fatalities.",

The weather organization is expecting a \"major winter storm\" will bring snow and ice across the country, \"from the Central Plains to the Mid-Atlantic\" this weekend.\nSunday night, there is a 90% chance of precipitation in Easton with snow expected mainly after 1 a.m., according to the National Weather Service. On Monday, there is a 90% chance of precipitation in Easton with snow expected before 1 p.m. and then rain and snow likely. Monday night, there is a 50% chance of precipitation.\nTalbot County Public Schools Communications Director Debbie Gardner said the district is monitoring the forecast to determine if closures will be necessary.\nDorchester County Emergency Management Division Director Jimmy Windsor said Dorchester County has warned all its departments of the predicted weather, including its Highway Division. He said the county's Highway Division is preparing its inclement weather plans.\nVan Emburgh said on Friday that Easton was putting plows on the fronts of trucks and loading salt into the trucks that spread salt.\n\"And we have equipment that we're placing around town that we'll use to address alleys and some of the tighter spots that we plow,\" he said.\nWindsor said it is important that residents make sure they take the usual winter preparedness precautions, such as making sure vehicles have gas in them. He said that residents who live in areas that are prone to power outages should make sure they have blankets and warm clothing in the event of an outage.\n\"And a supply of fresh water in case the power goes out and you're on well water and therefore you rely on the power for your water source,\" he said.\nVan Emburgh said it's helpful if residents do not park their cars on main streets.\n\"When people park on the streets, we have to plow around the cars and sometimes that can \u2014 depending on how much snow we get \u2014 that can get tricky and then we plow the cars in,\" he said.\nVan Emburgh also talked about the importance of not plowing snow from the sidewalks into the street.\n\"Because we then plow it back onto the sidewalk,\" he said, laughing. \"It's just a battle. (Residents) plow it onto the street. We plow it back onto the sidewalk. And they get mad at us.\"\nVan Emburgh said residents should plow snow off their sidewalks by starting in the center of the street and working toward a house or building so that the snow is plowed into a yard.\n\"Some properties don't have yards,\" he said. \"But if you plow it out in the street, it's just going to get pushed back onto the sidewalk. So we ask that everything moves away from the center of the street.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "date": "2024-02-20",
    "author": "SAPNA BANSIL Capital News Service",
    "content": "Bikers try (and try) to gut a state helmet law\n\n February 20, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: SAPNA BANSIL Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 955\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ANNAPOLIS \u2014 A group of bikers in leather vests and wispy beards greets lawmakers here each Monday of the legislative session, hoping this is the year they'll succeed in their galvanizing cause: gutting a Maryland law that requires them to wear helmets.The group, which calls itself A Brotherhood Against Totalitarian Enactments, has experienced decades of setbacks on the helmet issue. Its vociferous critics say ABATE's position is at a minimum, eccentric and at worst, dangerous.\nBut driven by a burning belief in personal freedom and a joy for riding, ABATE has used persistent, grassroots activism to keep the helmet issue alive in Maryland. It's why in nearly every legislative session since the state's mandatory helmet law took effect in 1992, the Maryland General Assembly has at least considered a bill that would make wearing a helmet optional for most riders.\n\"It's been 32 years this year to no avail,\" said Bob Spanburgh, Maryland ABATE's board chairman. \"But we keep introducing it. We have some pretty ardent supporters. We have a lot of people who think we're nuts, probably.\"\nLike many of its previous incarnations over the last three decades, this year's bill would make wearing a helmet optional if a motorcyclist is at least 21 years old, has been licensed for a minimum of two years and has completed a safety course. It is named in honor of Gary \"Pappy\" Boward, a former ABATE executive director and motorcycle rights advocate who died in 2020 of health issues.\nABATE and other supporters insist that they aren't opposed to riders wearing helmets if they so choose. But they feel the current mandate abridges freedom of choice and represents government overreach.\n\"I firmly believe that we as government do better when we educate people, (rather) than legislating something,\" said Sen. Mike McKay (R-Allegany, Garrett and Washington), the bill's primary Senate sponsor and a friend of Boward's. \"There are people that would like to have the choice (to not wear a helmet). And I tend to believe that we should give people the choice but 100% support educating them about it.\"\nEstablished in 1974, ABATE will mark 50 years of advocacy for motorcyclists' rights this June. Its animating issue has been eroding Maryland's helmet law, different iterations of which have been in place since 1968. Today, Maryland joins 16 other states and the District of Columbia in requiring all riders to wear protective headgear.\nSpanburgh, a 66-year-old retired carpenter, only casually followed politics when he joined ABATE in the mid-1980s. Initially, he saw the group as a community of like-minded individuals, who shared his enthusiasm for bikes, firearms, the outdoors and rock and roll. But right away, ABATE turned Spanburgh into an unlikely activist.\n\"At the first meeting I went to, the thing they told me (was), 'You got to register to vote. It's very important in this organization,'\" Spanburgh recalled. \"That was actually the first time I ever registered to vote in my life. I was 27 at the time.\"\nEach legislative session, the helmet bill faces cockeyed glances and prodigious odds. Contending with a wealth of scientific evidence, which shows crashes involving non-helmeted motorcyclists are much more likely to result in severe head trauma and death, the measure almost always dies in committee.\nBut ABATE ensures the issue is revived and relitigated, year after year, by finding ways to get in front of elected officials, despite limited financial resources and dwindling numbers. In the past, the group used a tactic it called \"piss house politics,\" which involved following lawmakers into the bathroom to gain an audience and get its message heard.\n\"They're diehards for what they believe in,\" said Del. Jay Jacobs (R-Caroline, Cecil, Kent and Queen Anne's). \"Thank God they do. They don't let go of this stuff. It's a tough fight over here to get that kind of legislation passed.\"\nWhile Republicans are the most likely to sympathize with ABATE's cause, the group engages lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. This year's bill, cross-filed as HB639 and SB503, has bipartisan sponsors in both chambers.\n\"I don't agree with them that they shouldn't wear a helmet, but I do agree about the civil liberty issue,\" said Sen. Jill Carter (D-Baltimore City), one of the bill's Senate co-sponsors.\n\"They are adamant as dedicated motorcyclists that this is not something they want mandated to them,\" she added.\nIn a recent hearing of the House Environment and Transportation Committee, opponents included highway safety groups, medical associations and public health officials. They argued that a weaker helmet law would increase motorcyclists' risk of injury and death, impose an avoidable burden on taxpayers and encumber the healthcare system.\n\"A lot of people might say, 'Well, it's my free will to do whatever I want to do, no matter how stupid it is,'\" Gene Ransom, CEO of MedChi, the Maryland State Medical Society, said in an interview. \"The problem is, when it comes to healthcare \u2026 your decision then ends up costing the entire system a whole lot of money.\n\"Not only is it the right thing to do and the smart thing to do \u2014 logical people wear helmets when they ride a motorcycle or a bike or other things \u2014 it also is appropriate from a common good and cost point of view,\" Ransom added.\nThe bill is scheduled for a hearing before the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee later this week. Spanburgh hopes to see the measure make it out of committee and get a vote on the House or Senate floor. If unsuccessful, proponents vow they won't stop trying.\n\"If I don't do it, who else is going to do it?\" said Ken Eaton, Maryland ABATE's executive director. \"We try to get other people to help us as much as possible. But if I don't do it, how can I convince other people to do it?\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Easton woman charged with placing swastikas on political signs\n\n May 12, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Crime \n \n 564\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON \u2014 On Friday, police charged an Easton woman for allegedly placing swastika stickers on political signs and town property ahead of Easton's recent election.Jennifer Cristaudo, 53, has been charged with 20 counts of using a hate symbol, three counts of malicious destruction of property and one count of defacing property in a race/religion crime. All counts are misdemeanors.\nAccording to charging documents, Cristaudo allegedly placed six swastika stickers on political signs and 16 stickers with red lines through swastikas on town property, such as light poles and stop signs.\nThe six stickers placed on Gunsallus signs were all in \"high-minority areas,\" according to charging documents prepared by Detective Cory Schuch.\n\"The placement of a hate symbol, such as a swastika on campaign signs in these areas is a clear indication that Cristaudo's motivation was to intimidate minority voters in the Town of Easton to not vote for Frank Gunsallus,\" charging documents stated.\nPolice say the placement of the stickers began in late March and continued through early May. The election was held May 6.\nAccording to the Easton Police Department, on March 26, officers located three swastika stickers on Gunsallus signs. They reviewed surveillance video, which showed a woman driving a blue Subaru as the person placing the hate symbols.\nOn April 1, police discovered another defaced sign. April 28, officers found two more Gunsallus signs defaced near the Easton Amish Market.\nPer charging documents, police later found 16 swastika stickers with red lines throughout town, with 10 reported on April 1 and 2, and six reported between April 30 and May 6.\nAccording to court documents, a town official told police removing the stickers causes \"permanent damage\" to the signs, \"rendering them unusable.\" The town's public works department estimated $21,000 in replacement costs.\nIn addition to video footage linking Cristaudo to the stickers, court documents state police found a \"large roll of matching swastika stickers\" in Cristaudo's residence.\nMatching clothing and more stickers were found in her car, police said in charging documents.\nDuring the campaign, Gunsallus and his then-opponent Don Abbatiello both spoke out against sign vandalism. Gunsallus told The Star Democrat in March that \"these types of things shouldn't happen during a campaign.\"\n\"This act of hate has escalated the situation into a deeply troubling reality that demands our collective attention,\" Gunsallus wrote in a letter sent to The Star Democrat, local police and various local officials in March.\nRabbi Fred Scherlinder Dobb, interim rabbi for Temple B'Nai Israel and Satell Center for Jewish Life on the Eastern Shore, said he was \"disappointed\" but not \"shocked\" by the use of hate symbols.\n\"I would say Easton and Talbot County are mostly a wonderful refuge from some of that national division,\" he said. \"But sadly, and maybe inevitably, pieces of that creep in.\"\nDobb said the placement of hate symbols is \"utterly unacceptable\" no matter the intent. \"Full-on continental devastation and genocide \u2014 which is the ultimate Nazi legacy \u2014 needs to be reserved for issues far greater than Town Council,\" Dobb said.\nLt. Milton Orellana, special operations commander for the Easton Police Department, said Monday that the department had also received a report of a Ku Klux Klan hood being placed on a Gunsallus sign during the campaign. Police were not sure who was behind that incident.\nOrellana said police are actively investigating both incidents. A preliminary hearing for Cristaudo is set for June 20.\nGunsallus declined to further comment on the situation, citing the ongoing investigation. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

You will hear some success stories today,\" Price said.\nThe back row of the courtroom was packed with people supporting the graduates \u2014 Nichole Meredith, Samantha Mitchell and Carole Rawding. There were tearful testimonies to the power of this program. Love ones were showed the before and after pictures that marked the women's journey from the beginning of the program to the end.\nProblem Solving Coordinator Michelle Bethke spoke to the journey these women have taken and she presented certificates and flowers.\nEach graduate had a presenter. Meredith had lawyer Dana Boston, Mitchell had Whitely, and Rawding had Bethke.\nThere were lots of local dignitaries present, including Caroline County Commissioner Larry Porter, Sheriff Don Baker, Police Chief Geroge Bacorn and State's Attorney Sloan Franklin. Even Roger McKnight, MTU program administrator, was there.\nFrom state to county to town, there was community supporting these women to break the cycle of addiction and incarceration.\n\"It is an achievement and we are sending our graduates back out into the world to do good things,\" Price said.\nPrice noted the rigor of the program. Collectively the three graduates had submitted 382 drug tests. They completed 313 treatments of either substance abuse disorder or mental health treatment. They had to complete 146.25 hours of community service.\nBethke went up to the podium and addressed the crowded court room.\n\"The Caroline County Problem Solving Court employs science-based best practices to provide a pathway to sobriety for participants with diagnosed substance use disorders utilizing a combination of therapy, counseling, mentoring, encouragement and discipline when necessary,\" Bethke said.\nThe program received a $200,000 grant from the Maryland Office of Problem Solving Courts through a sub grant of the Bureau of Justice Assistance, which helped provide the program's staffing.\nA graduate from 2022's program, and keynote speaker at the May 10 graduation, is Whiteley.\n\"I am a recovering addict and alumni from the Problem Solving Court. The definition of recovery is the process of change for which individuals improve their health and wellness, live a self-directed life and strive,\" she said. \"The mindset and thinking pattern I once had, I needed to give up in order to change. Today I am a strong worthy loving and lovable woman, mother and friend.\"\nThe next speaker was Meredith.\n\"My addiction had taken everything that I ever loved away from me. I lost custody of my kids. I lost the trust and respect of my family. When I looked into the mirror, I didn't even recognize the person staring back at me,\" Meredith said. \"This program has saved my life. I have full custody of my kids now. My family and friends can depend on me.\"\nThe next to speak was Mitchell.\n\"Drug court has given me the resources I need when I need people,\" Mitchell said.\nThe final graduate, Rawding, was introduced by Bethke. Rawding was described as quiet and determined.\n\"I am just glad I accepted this program,\" Rawding said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Talbot County Sheriff's Office to place cameras in patrol cars\n\n July 11, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 465\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON \u2014 The Talbot County Sheriff's Office is planning to add cameras to its patrol vehicles, a move that Sheriff Joe Gamble said will increase transparency with the public.Earlier this month, Talbot County council members approved the purchase of 30 in-car cameras for $415,000, spread across a five-year period. Body-worn cameras have their limits, Gamble said, only showing the steering wheel during situations like police chases.\nThe sheriff said the in-car cameras have two main benefits.\n\"One, it's another level of transparency with the public,\" Gamble said. \"And the other is evidence gathering.\"\nBut Gamble noted that a state investigation into a fatal police-involved chase last year factored into the decision.\n\"It definitely played a role in it,\" he said.\nIn July 2024, Talbot County deputies and an Easton police officer engaged in a pursuit of a vehicle on U.S. Route 50 in Easton after the driver failed to pull over for a traffic stop. Police reached speeds over 100 mph, and the chase ended with the vehicle crashing into a tree on Black Dog Alley. An 18-year-old passenger died.\nThe Independent Investigations Division of the Maryland Attorney General's Office reviewed the incident, as it does for all fatal police-involved chases statewide. Body-worn camera footage was eventually released in September. It wasn't until January when state investigators determined they wouldn't seek charges against any of the involved officers.\nAt the time, Gamble said it shouldn't have taken that long for the state to complete its investigation and clear his deputies. Now, the in-car cameras will better show the actions taken by vehicles being pursued by police, he argues.\n\"You couldn't see the egregious disregard for public safety by the driver in that car,\" Gamble said in an interview this week, referencing the limited view of the chase provided by body-worn cameras.\n\"It protects our deputies in the sense that, this is what they did,\" he added. \"And if there's allegations they did something else, it's on footage.\"\nOther sheriffs on the Eastern Shore concur with the effectiveness of the cameras.\nQueen Anne's Sheriff Gary Hofmann said most patrol vehicles have had the in-car cameras for a few years. Complaints are down, and it's increased trust with the community, Hofmann says.\n\"It's been extremely beneficial for us to avoid any type of complaints or allegations,\" he said.\nDorchester Sheriff James Phillips said he would love for his agency to buy them, although cost is a problem \u2014 the in-car cameras are more expensive than body-worn ones.\nIn Caroline County, the vehicle cameras were purchased under a former sheriff, current Sheriff Donnie Baker noted. They are key in providing a better perspective for traffic stops and other incident, he said.\n\"I think that they make a good cop better,\" Baker said, \"and they limit false reports.\"\nGamble said the Talbot County Sheriff's Office hopes to install all 30 in-car cameras by 2026. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The state is not prosecuting previously levied charges against Todd for attempted murder and assault.\nTodd was the last of four people to enter pleas for an incident that occurred in April 2024. Three others accused of assaulting Todd during the incident \u2014 21-year-old Tucker Eason, 19-year-old Blake Dorman and 18-year-old Navelie White \u2014 have pleaded guilty to assault charges. They were each handed sentences that they are currently serving.\nThe incident occurred in the parking lot of the Kohl's on April 16, 2024. The Easton Police Department said Todd fired a gun after an assault took place, according to a press release from when Todd was arrested in October 2024. Police spoke with a person whose truck had been hit by a bullet, allegedly from Todd's handgun.\nAccording to police, Todd told them that while in the parking lot that day, Eason hit him on the head with a beer bottle. Another person had a tire iron, Todd told authorities. Todd also told police he was punched several times.\nDetectives interviewed a witness who identified Eason, Dorman and White as the people who attacked Todd.\nAt the time, Easton police said video showed the attack during which Todd fired his gun after the assault ended with people fleeing the area.\nOn June 26, Judge Philip Cronan sentenced Todd to one year for reckless endangerment with the full term suspended, and two years for the handgun charge with all but 212 days suspended. Todd was credited with 212 days served dating back to last November. Cronan ordered Todd to serve two years on probation and perform community service, among other conditions.\nWhite, of Easton, entered an Alford plea for first-degree assault on March 21. He was sentenced to eight years with all but 18 months suspended, dating back to January.\nEason, of Easton, pleaded guilty in December 2024 to second-degree assault and was sentenced to a three-year term with all but 18 months suspended. The 18 months date back to October 2024.\nDorman, of St. Michaels, pleaded guilty on June 4 to second-degree assault and rioting. A three-year sentence for the rioting was fully suspended. For the assault count, Cronan delivered a three-year sentence with all but 18 months suspended, dating to June 3. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Bodman, who is charged with manslaughter, distribution and possession with the intent to distribute narcotics, distribution and possession with intent to distribute fentanyl or heroin, possession of a controlled dangerous substance, reckless endangerment and conspiracy.Police also announced that Elina Lazarieva, 23, of Easton was arrested in Baltimore on Aug. 2 on similar charges.The charges stem from the duo's alleged involvement in an overdose death in Easton.Easton officers were dispatched to the 100 block of Prospect Avenue on Sept. 5, 2022, for an unresponsive man.Talbot County paramedics also responded and pronounced the man, identified as 28-year-old Cristian Gonzales, dead.Easton police's criminal investigation division initiated an investigation, learning that Lazarieva had met with Bodman for the purpose of obtaining controlled dangerous substances.Police said Lazarieva contacted Bodman and the two traveled to Delaware to obtain heroin.After obtaining the heroin, the two traveled back to Easton and delivered the drug to Gonzales, who later overdosed, police said.Both Bodman and Lazarieva were turned over to the Talbot County Detention Center following their arrests.Lazarieva was released on bond Sept. 12, according to online court records. Her case is scheduled for a jury trial in Talbot County Circuit Court in early January. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

A date remembered and honored by many in Queen Anne's County for the last 22 years the Fallen Heroes Memorial continues to be observed Feb. 13. Hosted by Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 108, the location has varied through the years but was held this year at the Centreville United Methodist Church.The event began with the Pledge of Allegiance and a moment of silence led by Sheriff Gary Hoffman. Senior Pastor Rev. Karen Handy of Centreville Methodist Church welcomed and addressed families, friends, and community members.\nChase Armington, past president of Lodge 108 and current Queen Anne's County deputy, began, \"Tonight, we gather to honor our fallen heroes. It is our duty to never forget them, for they have paved the path forward with their lives. The path leading us here tonight was born from tragedy. Incredible losses. Unbearable pain for our families, friends, and the community. These honored in front of you served our community with pride, dignity, and honor. Knowing their lives could, at any moment be taken, so that we may live. So that we may continue on the path they have now paved.\"\nThe event started from tragedy, continues years later as a way to honor and remember those who have unselfishly given their lives for others. Sue Nickerson, who lost her son, Centreville Police Officer Michael Nickerson, in 2001 explains, \"The FOP from QAC started [this event] and they will always have it on February 13th, the night that Michael [Nickerson] and Jason [Schwenz, Queen Anne's County deputy] were killed. But, it's to honor all emergency people who have passed away in the line of duty from Queen Anne's County.\"\nNickerson is the Maryland Concerns of Police Survivors (COPS) Director.\nAs a mother who lost her son, this event is near to her heart. Nickerson said, \"It means a lot. It really does. QAC is willing to step up, and support the families, and acknowledge the jobs that our law enforcement, our firefighters, and our EMTs have done. It is very much appreciated.\"\nFirst responders marched in for the Presentation of Colors, holding flags to honor those lost in the line of duty. Queen Anne's County State's Attorney, Lance Richardson, spoke about stoicism and how it applies here. \"The heroes we celebrate tonight were tragically taken from us. We don't have any control over that. But what we do have control over is how we respond to it, how we react, how we pick up the pieces and go on. Stoicism also places an emphasis on appreciating the unity and precious gift of life.\"\nRichardson went on to quote the Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius, \"When you arise in the morning, think of what a precious privilege it is to be alive \u2014 to breathe, to think, to enjoy, to love.\" Applying this quote, Richardson said, \"So, tonight, we honor those who gave the ultimate sacrifice, their lives, so we could go on living our lives in peace and safety.\" He ended by encouraging all to 'earn this.' \"We must continue to honor these brothers and sisters, live a life that would be a testament to their memory, and continue to do God's will and God's work.\"\nDuring this powerful remembrance, family members came, first responder representatives saluted, and all placed long-stemmed red roses by the framed photographs. The names of the fallen heroes were read along with the date of their End of Watch. Ten Queen Anne's County residents and fallen heroes' pictures filled the front table: Queen Anne's-Hillsboro Volunteer Fire Company's Daniel Lister, Sudlersville Volunteer Fire Company''s \"Buck\" Clough, Kent Island Volunteer Fire Department's \"Dougie\" Thomas, United Community Volunteer Fire Department''s David Brinkley, Centreville Police Department's Michael Nickerson, QA Sheriff's Deputy Jason Schwenz, DNR Warden Charles Rider, and Maryland State Police troopers Thomas Noyle, Philip Russ, and Wallace Mowbray.\nRadio transmission echoed for all to hear to mark the ultimate sacrifice given on that fateful Feb. 13, 2001, \"Today we honor the memory and pay tribute to those who greatly served and protected QAC and the State of Maryland. May their dedication and sacrifice never be forgotten and may they rest in eternal peace.\" Bagpipes played 'Amazing Grace' from the balcony overhead. Silence filled every space of the church.\nHandy closed, \"Lord, you gave them the gift of courage of serving others. Lord, mend those hearts that are broken in the loss of these loved ones. Lord, we pray that this memorial tonight has brought a bit of peace. Lord, we lift up and thank you for each of these persons. We thank you and pray for those that they have left behind.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Deputies are familiar with those in their patrol sectors and conduct frequent area checks \u2014 this is standard practice,\" said Julie Sin, public information officer for the Lee County Sheriff's Office.\nSin said deputies receive active shooter training and the agency deploys surveillance towers and increases patrols during religious holidays and large gatherings.\nIn Madison, Wisconsin, the First Congregationalist Church of Christ had an LGBTQ pride banner vandalized in June. In December 2024 a mass shooting at Abundant Life Christian School in Madison killed three (including the 15-year-old shooter who police said took her own life).\nAnother shooter targeted a Christian school in Nashville in 2023, killing three young children and three adults before being shot and killed by police.\nAnthony Vogel, a spokesman for the Madison Police Department, said local law enforcement has \"threat assessment\" and \"criminal intelligence\" to investigate threats and disseminate those leads to officers on patrol.\n\"The Madison Police Department offers the option of hiring officers for Special Duty to provide police presence and security,\" Vogel said of options for religious and other groups putting on events.\nBut Cathal Walsh, vice president and chief security officer for Guidepost Solutions (a New York-based security firm) said increased police presence can be temporary, centered around holidays, weekly services or special events as well as after high-profile incidents or threats.\n\"The police presence is always temporary,\" Walsh said, noting law enforcement can't be at churches 24/7.\n'VERY SERIOUSLY'\nThere have also been increased police and security footprints at Jewish synagogues during the recent High Holidays and the anniversary of Hamas' Oct. 7 attacks in Israel (which occurred on the Jewish holiday of Simchat Torah / the Feast of Tabernacles).\n\"We take security very seriously,\" said David Holtz, Temple administrator for Temple B'nai Israel in Easton, Maryland, citing \"the considerable uptick of anti-Semitic threats violence.\"\nThat includes the killing of a couple who worked at the Israeli Embassy in Washington D.C. and the attack on elderly demonstrators at a rally for Oct. 7 hostages in Boulder, Colorado, earlier this year.\n\"We have a gate that requires a code or approved entry for access to our parking area. We have magnetic locks on both the exterior entrance vestibule doors and the interior doors to our temple's lobby,\" Holtz said. \"We have security cameras throughout the interior and the exterior of the Temple. We have both off-duty sheriff's officers (armed and in uniform with marked vehicles) and private security personnel available for every service, Religious School or gathering event.\"\nHoltz said for the Yom Kippur holiday on Oct. 2 guards were posted both inside and outside the Maryland synagogue \"both as deterrent against any malicious actions and as peace of mind for our members and congregants.\"\n'I'M GOING TO BURN IT DOWN'\nThe Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) has published a best practices guide for mosques and security.\nIts recommendations include having a \"vigilant\" security / usher staff that can give early warnings to congregants, approach suspicious individuals before they enter the house of worship and do their best to keep erratic or violent behavior outside.\n\"Unknown males with bulky, camouflage, or combat-type clothing, for example, need to be approached and asked if they can be helped, Should the attacker engage persons outside the mosque, every effort must be made to keep the intruder from getting inside the mosque in order to minimize casualties,\" the CAIR guide reads.\nSome of the vandals and shooters have some kind of animus towards a specific faith or church. Others hold some kind of personal grievance or grudge.\nOn Oct. 1, police in Dearborn Heights, Michigan received a threat from a man in Texas saying he would burn down a local mosque.\n'I'm going to burn it down,\" the caller said, according to Michigan police.\n'TARGET NO. 1'\nSecurity experts are seeing houses of worship upping their security efforts via increased staffing, surveillance and physical barriers. Some religious venues are considering or have deployed metal detectors at entrances.\n\"Many houses of worship are increasing security presence in response to recent shootings, including posting off-duty law enforcement officers, trained volunteers, or professional armed security,\" said Gene Petrino, CEO of Survival Response LLC, a Florida-based security consulting firm.\n\"Some facilities are adjusting access points, adding fencing, controlled entrances, or security checkpoints,\" he said.\nOthers are adding surveillance cameras, motion detectors and alarm systems.\nSkoczylas, a former law enforcement officer, said larger churches and dioceses have more resources and money than smaller congregations to have paid security guards or to buy security cameras and other equipment.\n\"They're not going to have the funds to hire a security force,\" Skoczylas said.\nHe said small churches and other groups can look at training volunteers.\nSkoczylas said that can cost in the range of $1,500 for a security training versus hiring off-duty cops or security, which he said can regularly cost thousands of dollars.\nHe said the reality for security personnel (paid or volunteer) is to be armed.\n\"A security agent who is unarmed is nothing more than target number one,\" Skoczylas said.\nThat can run up against churches and other houses of worship wanting to be welcoming places.\n\"The goal is a visible deterrent while maintaining a welcoming environment,\" said Petrino, a former SWAT commander.\nWalsh agrees it's a balancing act between security and feeling like a welcoming place.\nRoman Catholic churches, for example, have long prided themselves on having sanctuaries open for those who want to come in and pray or meditate.\nBut Walsh said parishioners now will be concerned if they don't see some security, especially during holidays and big events.\n\"They kind of get a little bit worried,\" he said.\nASSESSMENTS & SOLUTIONS\nWalsh suggests houses of worship look at entrances and exits and parking lots for vulnerabilities and how they fit into security plans and emergency responses.\nHe also said religious groups could look at having attendees register in advance for some events.\nWalsh also said there are federal grants available through the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and U.S. Department of Homeland Security for nonprofits and religious venues to upgrade their security infrastructure.\n\"You might receive the funding to install more security cameras,\" Walsh said. \"Those opportunities are out there.\"\nSome houses of worship are looking at how much to advertise events on social media and are looking more at potential threatening individuals making menacing online comments.\nThat is also a balancing act with social media serving as a primary conduit for religious groups connecting with local communities.\n\"Social media is very touchy,\" Skoczylas said. \"It's the conduit of all things good and bad.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It's been minor flooding so far,\" said Rescue Fire Company Chief Adam Pritchett Friday afternoon. \"I believe the high tides are expected to be tonight of concern for Cambridge. But as of right now, it's been minor flooding so far.\"\nThe Town of Oxford warned residents that higher-than-expected tides could cause further flooding in the area Friday evening.\n\"Please be aware that the NOAA prediction for this evening's high tide has changed significantly and is now anticipated to be 4.5 feet, which could produce major flooding,\" the town said in an email to residents Friday afternoon. \"By comparison, this morning's high tide that resulted in flooding throughout the town registered as a 3.9-foot tide at the Cambridge marker. With a 4.5-foot tide, the Causeway area will be impassable for a period of time.\"\nDebby was downgraded to a tropical depression late Thursday afternoon, and was a post-tropical cyclone on Friday, the National Hurricane Center said. It made landfall early Monday on the Gulf Coast of Florida as a category 1 hurricane. Then, Debby made a second landfall early Thursday in South Carolina as a tropical storm.\nPritchett said his department was ready to help with any impacts from Friday evening's tides.\n\"We pretty much stay at a ready pace for things like this because it's becoming more normal all the time now with each storm that passes on,\" he said. \"So we're kind of always ready for events like this.

The entire continental U.S. will be able to view the event with parts of 13 states from Texas to Maine able to see the moon completely block out the sun for 3 to 4 minutes.It will be the second largest total solar eclipse in the U.S. since 1806\nAll the travel, spending and social media activity could also cause some issues.\nDestination Mansfield, an Ohio tourism group, has put together a list of eclipse tips in addition to wearing protective eclipse glasses.\nThose tips include being prepared for overloaded internet networks, traffic congestion at popular viewing spots and having some cash in case payment networks are overwhelmed or disrupted. The group recommends filling up cars with gas and stocking up on food and other staple items just in case.\nMany schools, especially in the eclipse path will also also be closed April 8.\nPolice, fire departments and hospitals could also see increased volumes.\nThere will be livestreams of the event broadcasted online by NASA (nasa.gov), the Exploratorium museum in San Francisco (www.exploratorium.edu/eclipse) and TimeandDate.com (https://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/solar/2024-april-8). \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The 911 operator listened, gave me directions, kept me calm and told me that the medical team was on its way. Within 15 minutes of the call, the crew arrived. I call it a crew because at least two trucks from the Easton fire department accompanied the ambulance.\nThe fire department members shoveled the snow off the entrance to my house within a matter of minutes to give a safer passageway for the EMS crew. The EMS crew handled my wife's situation quickly and efficiently, moved her to the ambulance for transport to the emergency room. They kept apologizing for bringing snow into the house \u2014 the least of my concerns.\nThe entire team put themselves at risk to help us. The quickness of their response, especially considering the weather, was amazing. The coordination among the team was astonishing.\nAgain, I thank God for those who dedicate themselves to the well-being of our Easton community. By the way, my wife is doing OK.\nBILL MOCARSKY\nEaston \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Kayak group offers law enforcement, firefighters, vets a chance to relax\n\n June 9, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Michael Reid mreid@somdnews.com | Section: News \n \n 734\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Sure, dropping his fishing rod overboard while his son Shane fought to land a chain pickerel during the Heroes on the Water event Saturday at St. Mary's River State Park could have been an embarrassing moment, but Thornton Jackson was just planning ahead.Kayaks can be very temperamental when it comes to balance, so the Waldorf resident was just jettisoning weight in anticipation of the weight of the fish being added to the tandem kayak. Or that one excuse, anyways.\n\"I did do that,\" he said happily \u2014 and somewhat relieved \u2014 when it was suggested to him.\nThe event was held to allow first responders, law enforcement, firefighters and military veterans a chance to relax and and take a few casts if they so desired.\n\"It's not serious fishing. We're just out to have a good time, relaxing time on the water,\" said Maryland Chapter Coordinator Chris Vassallo, who spent 21 years as a senior chief in the U.S. Navy on submarines and recently retired following a career with the Office of Naval Intelligence. \"You're maneuvering the kayak, you're using your fishing tackle to try and outsmart [the fish] and it takes your mind off everything else. It shuts that noise off and gives your brain some peace and for me that's what this is all about.\"\nThornton Jackson spent 13 years as a Yeoman in the U.S. Navy and was deployed \"multiple times\" and even missed the birth of Shane, \"but it was also nice getting back and meeting him at the pier.\"\nAnd Thornton Jackson certainly appreciated the father-son bonding time.\n\"It's definitely nice to get away from everything and just being out here spending time with him and just be a dad,\" said Jackson, who has worked in naval intelligence for the past two years. \"Right now I'm here for a bit, but with deployments you never know when they're going to pop up. Just getting some time out on a Saturday and putting the work away to focus on him is great.\"\n\"It was fun to spend time with him,\" said 8-year-old Shane, who reeled in several fish. \"I miss him a lot [when he's gone].\"\nVassallo found out about the organization while listening to a podcast and attended an event in Montgomery County.\n\"That was something that I wanted, something that I wanted to establish here in Southern Maryland,\" he said. \"To me this is what it's all about; having the camaraderie and being out on the water and enjoying the time on the water.\"\nHe co-coordinated two events and coordinated previous events this year in Laytonsville and Salisbury. The next event will be held July 26 at Mallows Bay in Charles County.\nOne of the volunteers at the event was Wayne Stinchcomb, a retired U.S. Army chaplain.\n\"Some of these guys are going through trials and tribulations for what they're going through. They're going through counseling. But when you do something like this it gets them back into real life,\" he said. \"[They think] I can do this, I can be around my guys and I don't have to worry about something or what somebody might think because we're all going through it or been through it. One guy was here just to float in the sun. He didn't even take his pole out. He said the whole idea was to be and relax. If you've been in combat or anything you've been around, and you're around like-minded folks, there's an ease in that.\"\nMark Anderson of Kent Island drove about two hours to volunteer for the event.\n\"I didn't serve but I've shot [guns and rifles] competitively with a lot of people who are veterans,\" said Anderson, who is works in information technology and captured the event with his drone. \"I just got to know a lot of them and really appreciate what they do for this country and the sacrifices they've made.\"\n\"I just love the military and fishing so that's how I figured I could at least give back,\" said Nathan Miller, who drove down from Westminster to assist at the event. \"My friend brought me out once [to a Heroes on the Water event] and I've been hooked ever since. If there's an event and I know about it ahead of time, I'll figure out a way to help. It's good to see [them relax]. It's worth the drive.\"\nFor more information on how to participate or to volunteer at the Mallows Bay event on July 26, email maryland@heroesonthewater.org. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

And they are, quite frankly, they\u2019re a holy terror.\u201d\n\nCouncil members placed juvenile crime on their top-priority list for the upcoming General Assembly session. Councilmember Mike Detmer urged action, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely insane that we have so many people that have had direct and directly affected by this, multiple people in this room directly affected by juvenile crime,\u201d and added, \u201cThere are kids that are still kids on paper. They\u2019re not acting like children.\u201d Council President George Pfeffer noted the topic is \u201cequally important to us,\u201d while Councilmember Ricky Travers said the system is \u201csetting up a whole group of young kids for failure.\u201d\n\nThe county\u2019s push mirrors regional concern: Caroline, Queen Anne\u2019s and Kent counties are also exploring a jointly built facility. A March Cambridge police report found \u201cthe overwhelming suspect profiles for these crimes are male juveniles under the age of 16,\u201d and Chief Justin Todd noted one 12-year-old has been arrested for vehicle theft 11 times in three years.",

    "content": "Sgt. Jeff Adams chose the Greensboro Police Department as his next endeavor because of his great relationship with Police Chief Lenox Trams. \"I was looking at different agencies but I reached out the chief. Chief and I go back to 2005 or 2006,\" Adams said. \"I didn't know if I wanted to come here or not. We just had a brief conversation, then I came and did an interview and instantly fell in love. Ever since talking to him and doing a ride along, I was pretty much sold.\"\n\nAdams, originally from New Jersey, came to the Eastern Shore in 2004 after careers in the Navy and Army Reserve. He began in law enforcement as an Easton Police Department dispatcher for one year, then spent the past 17 years with the Federalsburg Police Department. His decision to join Greensboro PD was also influenced by living in Greensboro. \"I think the people here are very nice,\" Adams said. \"They're genuine, and it just seem like a really good fit after we went for a ride along. Just the environment alone was was good enough.\"\n\nAdams describes himself as approachable: \"I'm easy going,\" Adams said. \"So what you see is what you get. I think Chief can attest to that, but I'm just laid back, professional, polite and kind. Hopefully we'll be community-oriented. We're just trying to make our interactions are police-public friendly.\"\n\nAdams brings his K-9 partner Mosley, who has been with him since 2017. Despite losing a leg to cancer in October 2023 and undergoing chemotherapy and radiation, Mosley continues to work. \"She's done everything,\" Adams said. \"She's already certified in tracking and narcotics. Now we took off the tracking because she lost her leg to cancer in Halloween of 2023... she's she's still working. She's did awesome with the training last Wednesday, she nailed it.\"\n\nWhile Mosley hasn't officially joined the force yet, both Trams and Adams expect her to become part of the team soon. \"We're really excited to be able to bring her on,\" Trams said. \"We're going through our budget cycle, and we put the K-9 program in the budget so the Town Council has to approve it. Hopefully we'll get the thumps up and then she can start working because we need one.\"",

    "content": "An Easton man was sentenced Wednesday to 18 years in federal prison for attempted coercion and enticement of a minor to engage in illicit sexual activity. U.S. District Judge George L. Russell III handed down the prison term to Samuel Charles Hardeman, 55. His prison term will be followed by lifetime supervised release.\n\nHardeman had a previous federal conviction in a 2002 case in the Northern District of Georgia for use of a computer to entice a child to engage in sexual activity, for which he was sentenced to 174 months in prison. Upon his release from prison, Hardeman must continue to register as a sex offender in the places where he resides, where he is an employee and where he is a student, under the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act, per the judge's order.\n\nAccording to the guilty plea, from Dec. 11, 2022, through Dec. 26, 2022, Hardeman engaged in conversations with an undercover law enforcement officer who purported to have a 10-year-old daughter. During the conversations, Hardeman expressed how he wanted to have sex with the 10-year-old, sent a video containing child pornography to the undercover officer and made plans to drive to New York, where the undercover officer purportedly lived, to have sex with the 10-year-old. Hardeman communicated with the undercover officer by phone via video call, text and through the use of encrypted messaging platforms. The Maryland U.S. Attorney's Office said the conversations occurred while Hardeman was on the sex offender registration for a previous federal sex offense conviction.",

    "content": "A fraudulent marijuana operation is targeting University of Delaware students and Newark residents through illegal delivery offers, prompting an investigation by the Delaware Division of Alcohol & Tobacco Enforcement. The agency issued a public alert Thursday after receiving reports of flyers and business cards being distributed around Newark that falsely claim association with Fresh Cannabis, the licensed dispensary on Ogletown Road.\n\n\"The impostors are attempting to mislead potential customers into purchasing marijuana products illegally,\" said Jon Peterson, a spokesman for DATE. One advertisement features a cartoon marijuana leaf character holding a joint with the message \"UDEL-iver? Yes we do!\" targeting UD students. The ad promises \"Quick delivery for on-campus students only! (DoorDash/Uber Eats Style!)\" and includes the Fresh Cannabis logo along with an offer of free marijuana samples for students who sign up. Another ad displaying the Fresh Cannabis logo shows a menu and claims 24/7 delivery service.\n\nPeterson emphasized that no licensed Delaware dispensary is authorized to deliver marijuana products. \"Any business claiming to offer delivery services is operating illegally,\" he said. \"Delaware's adult-use marijuana marketplace includes strict regulations and testing standards designed to ensure consumer safety. Products sold through illegal channels bypass these safeguards and may contain dangerous contaminants such as mold, pesticides or heavy metals.\" Despite Delaware's legalization of recreational marijuana, selling outside licensed dispensaries remains illegal.\n\nAnyone with information about these fraudulent materials should contact Cpl. Tristin Burris at tristin.b.burris@delaware.gov. \"DATE's Marijuana Enforcement Unit is actively investigating this matter and encourages anyone with information about these fraudulent materials to come forward,\" Peterson said.",

    "content": "The Maryland Supreme Court heard arguments Friday at Easton High School on whether police can stop drivers for cell-phone use \u201cin a manner that is consistent with sending a text message or initiating a phone call.\u201d The case, State of Maryland v. Michael Eugene Stone, asks the high court to overturn an appellate ruling that threw out controlled-dangerous-substance evidence found after Washington County officers stopped Stone in May 2023 when they saw him \u201cmanipulate a cell phone that was attached to his windshield.\u201d\n\nThe Washington County Circuit Court had denied Stone\u2019s motion to suppress, but in January the Appellate Court ruled \u201cThere is insufficient evidence in the record from which the trial court could properly conclude that the officers had reasonable suspicion to conduct a traffic stop.\u201d\n\nAssistant Attorney General Jillian Chieppor urged reversal, contending officers had reasonable suspicion because Stone pressed his phone in a way \u201cconsistent\u201d with typing a text. She warned that \u201cforcing officers to wait until the consequence occur goes against the law's purpose.\u201d Justice Brynja Booth pushed back: \u201cIt seems like if we accept the state's position, any time somebody touches a cell phone device, that would constitute reasonable suspicion. Wouldn't we be casting a really wide scope?\u201d\n\nPublic defender Douglas Nivens II countered, \u201cThis is a case about Mr. Stone \u2026 reaching up to touch the screen of his cell phone mounted on his dashboard,\u201d adding, \u201cOne touch being the grounds for a traffic stop is a bridge too far.\u201d Asked what officers would need for reasonable suspicion, Nivens said location of the phone and observation time matter because \u201cWe don't want officers just stopping people at random because they have a hunch.\u201d\n\nA decision is expected later.",

There were a lot of people in their 20s and 30s, and they had a great time too. It's amazing that some of these youngsters really knew the music. They know our songs that we grew up with.\"\n\nFeehley encouraged everyone to honor veterans daily: \"When you see that Army hat or the Coast Guard bumper sticker on the back of a car, or anything that says, 'Hey, I was in the service,' say, 'Thank you for your service.' Because that veteran, the person who wears that hat, or the person who drives that car, they gave an awful lot of themselves. They took time away from their families, away from home, in some but not all cases, they put themselves in danger, so you and I can do what we do today, and who are we not to give back to those people.\"",

Williams also faces a separate January trial for the Dec. 8, 2022, 10 p.m. fatal shooting of 69-year-old Lory Eugene Fields in the 700 block of High Street, roughly three hours after Daniels was killed.",

EMS Division Chief Tina Kintop said the program lets any first responder \u201ccome from the bottom up, meaning that they will know who all the peer (team members) are \u2026 They will be able to contact who they want to contact,\u201d bypassing the chain of command for help.\n\nCounty Manager Clay Stamp praised the effort during the Oct. 22 council meeting, noting, \u201cThe things that we expose our 18-year-old kids to \u2014 that become EMTs or dispatchers or police officers \u2014 are horrendous. We have got to come up with a better way to arm these individuals to deal with these things in a healthy manner and to give them a support system. And right here in Talbot County, out of the 23 counties and Baltimore City, they've stepped up, and they're making it happen first.\u201d Former EMS Chief Matt Watkins added, \u201cTalbot County should be extremely proud of the fact that we're on the cutting edge of this.\u201d\n\nAfter more than a year of planning and a \u201crigorous\u201d four-day training led by ex-NYPD detective Jeff Thompson, a second training phase will enlarge the peer team and expand outreach. For All Seasons CEO Beth Anne Dorman said a $30,000 Rural Maryland Council grant funded the clinical training. Council President Chuck Callahan, recalling his own 18-year-old firefighter days, told first responders, \u201cYou kind of feel like you're out there alone sometimes, and you need to talk to somebody \u2026 As long as we're up here, you guys are never ever going to get forgotten, because you're our heroes in Talbot County, and we love you guys and you protect us.\u201d",

    "content": "Eleven patients were transported to the hospital after a Kia Sportage failed to stop at a stop sign at the four-way intersection of Matthewstown Road and Three Bridge Branch Road just before 8 a.m. Monday and crashed into the side of a Caroline County school bus, causing the bus to roll over.\n\nAccording to a statement from Caroline County Public Schools, the bus was transporting high school students involved in the Navy Junior Reserve Officers Training Corps program to Easton High School. Nine students and the bus driver were transported to area hospitals, and all parents of children on the bus were notified. The juvenile driver of the Kia Sportage, whose identity is being withheld by police, was also transported to an area hospital for treatment of injuries. In an email sent to parents Monday morning, Talbot County Public Schools Superintendent Sharon Pepukayi said the driver was an Easton High School student.\n\nPolice said the cause of the crash is under investigation and charges may be filed. Fog blanketed the area, though neither school system issued a fog delay. Troopers from the Maryland State Police Easton Barrack, Commercial Vehicle Enforcement Division and crash team responded, along with deputies from the Talbot County Sheriff's Office and Caroline County Sheriff's Office. All lanes on Matthewstown Road at Three Bridge Branch Road were closed for several hours; they closed off Route 328 at Black Dog Alley and at Councell Road, allowing only parents of the students and emergency services through.",

    "content": "The Trappe Volunteer Fire Company, housed in a station built in 1951 and never updated, is campaigning for a $6 million replacement. \u201cWe probably have the oldest one in the county,\u201d Assistant Secretary Treasurer Cheryl Lewis said, explaining that the current building cannot accommodate modern apparatus. Because Trappe relies on volunteers, \u201cprojects like this rely heavily on government and local support,\u201d Lewis noted.\n\nThe department had secured a line item in the recently approved federal budget, but it was later removed. \u201cWe\u2019ve been in the process of trying to get assistance,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cIn the last budget year \u2026 we had successfully worked with Andy Harris\u2019s office to be included in the budget. But with the cuts that were done early on this year, it was removed.\u201d Rep. Andy Harris (R-Md. 1st) said the appropriations bill failed \u201cdue to negotiations in Congress leading to a continued delay,\u201d though the project has been resubmitted. \u201cWe hope the appropriations process has a better outcome, but then that\u2019s not up to us because it involves the minority party as well,\u201d Harris said.\n\nTo qualify for federal aid the company must raise 25 percent of the cost\u2014$1.5 million\u2014and has already banked $450,000. Their next fundraiser is the annual fair, July 31\u2013Aug. 2 at the firehouse, 6\u201310 p.m. daily, featuring rides, food, games, and Saturday\u2019s parade. Harris stressed that final funding hinges on bipartisan agreement: \u201cIn the end, this is going to depend on the minority party. And you know, if they\u2019re not willing to negotiate in good faith, that could end up being a problem. The people in Trappe have to know that their member of Congress was working hard to get that money to the fire company.\u201d",

    "content": "ELKTON \u2014 Tom and Nancy Minor stood in front of the charred remains of 317 Willow Drive and remembered 10-year-old Kyleigh Nicole Treadway, who died in a Christmas-morning fire. \u201cKyleigh was so sweet. She was a most vivacious girl, always smiling. She loved to give hugs and loved animals. She loved our cats and always asked about them whenever she saw us,\u201d Nancy, 67, said. Tom, 66, added, \u201cNothing seemed to faze her. Kyleigh always seemed to be upbeat, like nothing was impossible.\u201d Nancy recalled their last encounter: \u201cIt was right before school was out for Christmas break. She was telling me about all of her animals\u2026 She said, \u2018I love you\u2019 and hugged her grandmom. Then she hugged me, too, and said, \u2018I love you\u2019,\u201d prompting Tom to observe, \u201cI don\u2019t think she encountered anyone she didn\u2019t love.\u201d\n\nSingerly Volunteer Fire Company and others responded about 7:30 a.m. to the blaze, Master Deputy State Fire Marshal Oliver J. Alkire reported. \u201cUpon arrival, firefighters found the family standing outside their home, stating a young girl was still inside. Firefighters heroically entered the home and located the child. However, she was later pronounced deceased on the scene,\u201d Alkire said, adding, \u201cInvestigators later learned that after family discovered the fire, they made several attempts to save Kyleigh during the fast-moving fire; however, they were unable to due to thick smoke and intense heat.\u201d The medical examiner ruled Kyleigh\u2019s death \u201cthermal injuries and smoke inhalation.\u201d Alkire stressed, \u201cWhile the fire remains under investigation, they have not recovered evidence that it was an intentionally set fire, nor do they believe or suspect that this was an intentionally set fire, and continue to explore all possible accidental causes.\u201d\n\nThe blaze displaced 17 residents, including Kyleigh\u2019s five surviving relatives, and most of the family\u2019s pets perished. The American Red Cross is assisting all displaced residents. Community tributes appeared at the scene; Rising Sun resident Kathi, who did not know the family, said, \u201cI did not know Kyleigh and I do not know her family, but I just wanted to come here today.\u201d\n\nCoworker Theresa Retz launched a GoFundMe on Tuesday with Kyleigh\u2019s mother Theresa Moats\u2019 permission. \u201cWe work together, but we are also good friends,\u201d Retz said, recalling, \u201cI only met Kyleigh a couple of times. But I can say Kyleigh made everyone smile. Her personality brightened a room, and she was the life of the party.\u201d Retz related Moats\u2019 first message after the fire: \u201cShe messaged me from a friend\u2019s Facebook account because her laptop had burned up along with everything else inside the house. She told me her house burned down and Kyleigh did not make it.\u201d Retz sensed Moats was \u201cemotionally discombobulated,\u201d explaining, \u201cShe wanted to know how to get up with the (Terumo) supervisor to let the company know that her badge and scrubs burned in the fire. That\u2019s how I knew her head was nowhere in the right place. I let her know that it\u2019s OK and don\u2019t worry about that right now.\u201d After meeting at the Red Cross-arranged hotel, Retz said, \u201cThere was a lot of crying.\u201d By Thursday the fundraiser had raised $17,414; Retz noted, \u201cPeople have been awesome. In addition to (monetary) donations, there has been an avalanche of donated clothing.\u201d",

    "content": "Three February crashes at the intersection of Brookletts Avenue and South Aurora Street in Easton have alarmed residents, especially because only 13 crashes had been logged there in the previous 11 years, according to the Easton Police Department, which attributed all three recent incidents to driver error. \"You stand out here for about five, ten minutes, you'll see how fast people go,\" Ruffini said. \"It's insane. They don't care, and they're always in a hurry.\"\n\nLydia Pinkney, who lives nearby, said she fears for her 9-year-old daughter and her dog after a car once careened into her yard and neighbors\u2019 parked cars have repeatedly been struck. \"The speed limit's 25, and I know people are going more than 25,\" she said. \"Our kids play out here. And what worries me about everything is if \u2026 someone's not paying attention or whatnot, them running the red light or just going way too fast and clipping me and my daughter.\"\n\nTown Engineer Rick Van Emburgh confirmed engineers have adjusted the traffic-light timing to reduce red-light running and are reviewing further safety tweaks. \"While this location is being monitored, officers have begun targeted traffic enforcement and will continue to do so at different hours of the day,\" the department wrote.\n\nBroader Brookletts Avenue safety efforts this month included converting two nearby intersections to four-way stops and adding on-street parking lines. \"The white lines give the drivers cues as to where they're supposed to be in the travel lanes,\" Van Emburgh said. \"Because one of the things that we struggle with is when you have a road that can accommodate on-street parking, but no one's actually parking on it, it looks like a wide-open raceway.\"\n\nResidents are split on the pending 123-unit redevelopment of the former Perdue AgriBusiness site. \"I have seen so many near accidents at the intersections, particularly Hanson and Brookletts,\" neighbor Lisa Stone said. \" \u2026 I think that's a good improvement.\" She added, \"Hopefully it will just be an increase in traffic and not a decrease in safety,\" while Ruffini warned, South Aurora Street \"will be a main road before you know it.\"",

    "content": "Jury trial opened Tuesday for Kenneth Bradley, 43, charged with first- and second-degree murder and kidnapping in the Feb. 7, 2024 disappearance and presumed death of 31-year-old Tiyavauna Britt at Gerry Boyle Park at Great Marsh in Cambridge. Prosecutors asked the jury for first-degree murder and kidnapping convictions, while defense counsel urged not-guilty verdicts on those counts, arguing second-degree murder or manslaughter fit the facts.\n\nDorchester County State\u2019s Attorney Amanda Leonard told jurors the case is full of \u201crage, control, domestic violence,\u201d saying evidence shows Britt\u2019s relationship with Bradley was \u201ctoxic.\u201d Leonard promised testimony from Bradley\u2019s former employer and a close friend to whom, she said, Bradley confessed to the murder and disposing of Britt\u2019s body. \u201cShe vanished,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cShe was never seen or heard from again. No phone calls or text messages.\u201d Jurors will see park video whose audio is \u201cchilling,\u201d Leonard said, showing Bradley drag Britt and throw her in the trunk of a car.\n\nPublic defender Matt Connell acknowledged, \u201cWe are fine acknowledging that that was him in the video,\u201d but objected that Bradley could have a \u201creasonable expectation\u201d for privacy during some conversations, noting \u201c90% of the verbal communication occurred inside the vehicle.\u201d Judge William Jones indicated it\u2019s \u201cquite likely\u201d the full recording will be admitted. In his opening, Connell conceded, \u201cHe lost it. He hit her too hard, and she died,\u201d adding Bradley tried to resuscitate Britt. \u201cHe didn\u2019t mean to do it.\u201d Connell urged, \u201cHold him responsible for what he\u2019s really guilty of, not above and beyond that.\u201d\n\nThirteen witnesses testified, including Britt\u2019s mother, Linda Harris, who recalled Feb. 12, 2024: \u201cShe wouldn\u2019t miss anything.\u201d Trial continues through Friday.",

    "content": "RIDGELY \u2014 The Ridgely commissioners voted unanimously Monday to continue the town\u2019s memorandum of understanding with the Caroline County Sheriff\u2019s Office. Commissioner Brad Sears, who backed the motion, said, \u201cI think at this point we\u2019re to a point where we would entertain a motion to give the town authorization to meet with the county to negotiate any changes to the MOU and go from there,\u201d adding that he still intends to negotiate details with the Sheriff\u2019s Office.\n\nThe town has relied on the Sheriff\u2019s Office since suspending its entire police department in March 2024 during a state investigation. On July 25, 2024, the Office of the State Prosecutor reported no \u201csufficient evidence of criminal activity warranting further investigation or prosecution,\u201d but the Ridgely officers had already been laid off.\n\nAt last month\u2019s meeting commissioners weighed three options. Sears recalled, \u201cI know last month we talked about three options, one completely going back to the sheriff\u2019s department regular patrol pattern. Second was to attempt to re-establish an original police force, and even that price was conservatively estimated at $852,000 for the first year if we could find the police officer.\u201d The third option\u2014continuing the MOU\u2014carries a fiscal-year 2026 cost of $493,415.\n\nCaroline County Sheriff Donald Baker urged adoption, stating, \u201cThe sheriff\u2019s office is providing what is going to be a high quality of law enforcement in the town. The town going with the MOU with the sheriff\u2019s office, they get everything the sheriff\u2019s office has to provide as far as criminal investigations handled by a investigator or detective, as well as the sheriff\u2019s office is a member of the Caroline County Drug Task Force and we have two deputies assigned to that.\u201d\n\nAddressing resident questions about the $493,415 allocation, Baker clarified, \u201cThere was some confusion that this money is dumped right into the Sheriff\u2019s Office budget. That\u2019s not true. The county is billing the town based upon the usage. So, if we don\u2019t use something or there\u2019s money left over, the county does not bill it and it goes back to the town or the town keeps it and it\u2019s never filled.\u201d Commissioner John Hurley was absent for the unanimous vote.",

    "content": "Three juveniles were injured\u2014one critically\u2014after a stolen Kia Optima slammed into an Owings home shortly before 6 p.m. Sunday, Sept. 14. Deputies had been alerted that the car, reported stolen out of Prince George\u2019s County, was entering Calvert County on Route 260. Deputy Justin MacWilliams spotted it, and investigators reported the driver \u201caccelerated at a high rate of speed, passing vehicles on the shoulder and operating recklessly.\u201d\n\nA pursuit began eastbound on Route 260, turned west onto Mt. Harmony Road, and continued despite stop-stick deployment. The sheriff\u2019s office said the driver even \u201cswerved the vehicle toward officers.\u201d The chase ended when the Kia failed to negotiate a turn near Alyssa Way, struck a telephone pole, crossed a yard, and \u201cultimately crashed into a residence.\u201d\n\nThree of the four juveniles inside were hurt; the driver was air-lifted in critical condition, while two passengers were taken by ambulance with non-life-threatening injuries. A fourth occupant fled on foot but was caught uninjured after deputies, K9 units, and drones set a perimeter. No names will be released under state law. The Office of the Attorney General\u2019s Independent Investigations Division declined to investigate; the Sheriff\u2019s Office Crash Reconstruction Unit now leads the case. Witnesses are asked to e-mail Deputy Jeffrey Hardesty at Jeffrey.Hardesty@calvertcountymd.gov and reference case 25-76666.",

Kyleigh, asleep in a second-floor bedroom, was trapped while her mother, grandmother, two brothers and mother\u2019s boyfriend Kevin Neal Summerfield escaped. \u201cAs firefighters battled the blaze, Moats alerted Capt.

Shane Hinson said the entire 39-officer force\u2014up from 29 when Todd took over\u2014now practices community-oriented policing after specialized training. \u201cIt\u2019s all of our jobs to go out and make meaningful connections with the community,\u201d Hinson said. Capt. Antoine Patton added, \u201cIf you look on the news, it would have you to believe sometimes that police officers are only there when bad things happen. But we want our community to know that we love them, and we\u2019re here to work together.\u201d He announced plans for a \u201c12 Days of Christmas\u201d shopping program Dec. 12-24 and a repeat Thanksgiving dinner for youth and seniors, noting, \u201cIn five to 10 years these children will be teenagers and these teenagers will remember the things that we did.\u201d\n\nTodd reported that officers have seized 114 illegal guns since 2019 and that homicides dropped from last year\u2019s record seven to two so far in 2023. \u201cI don\u2019t call that success by any means,\u201d he said. \u201cThe day we have zero is the day we\u2019ve been successful. [[---]] But it\u2019s progress.\u201d He warned that juvenile crime is worsening: \u201cOut of the 300-and-some assaults that we\u2019ve had this year, 127 have been committed by juveniles,\u201d and blamed the 2022 juvenile-justice reform that bars charges for children under 13. \u201cAnd the juveniles know it,\u201d Todd said. \u201cWe have 12-year-old kids telling us, \u2018What are you going to do to me?\u2019\u201d A new city curfew took effect Oct. 1; Todd said, \u201cBut at the end of the day, if we can help one child or one family, one parent to better parent their child, and get them out of the streets, then we\u2019ve done something right as a community and it\u2019s a start.\u201d\n\nThe department is recruiting to reach 43 officers by December and to diversify a workforce that is 67.5 % white, 22.5 % Black, and 5 % each Hispanic and Asian. \u201cWe want to mirror our community,\u201d Todd said. \u201cBut I just want the public to know we\u2019re working hard to get there.\u201d Resident Gary Gordy, one of the five attendees, said Cambridge needs more officers and surveillance cameras, adding, \u201cWe wait for years to get things done.\u201d",

    "content": "GREENSBORO \u2014 The Town of Greensboro announced Monday that it found \u201cdeliberate sabotage\u201d of its water system after residents reported higher-than-normal chlorine levels over the weekend.  \n\u201cAfter examining the tower wells, it was discovered that one of the chlorine regulators had been tampered with,\u201d the town stated, adding that the Caroline County Sheriff\u2019s Office has opened a criminal investigation.\n\nThe issue surfaced Saturday when the public works department asked contractor Susquehanna Operational Services to test the water. Resident Jose Miranda said \u201cthe smell is still really strong,\u201d noting no discoloration but an obvious chlorine odor.  \nWeekend readings peaked at 2.2 milligrams per liter\u2014well above the typical 0.56 mg/L\u2014before dropping to 1.0 mg/L on Monday; EPA standards flag levels above 4.0 mg/L as potentially harmful. A July 19 boil-water advisory had already been issued, and despite Sunday\u2019s Facebook assurance that \u201cthe water is safe to drink and within Maryland Department of the Environment regulations,\u201d multiple residents still reported noticeable chlorine taste and smell.\n\nResident Chris Mason said the water quality issue has been recurring in the last few weeks, adding that poor drinking water will especially effect those without refrigerator filters and mothers who need it for baby formula.  \nTown Manager Tammy Kelledes said the town changed its locks to prevent further tampering with the regulators. Residents can request water testing at 410-482-6222 or greensboro@greensboromd.com; tips on the sabotage can be reported to the Caroline County Sheriff\u2019s Office at 410-479-2515.",

    "content": "EASTON \u2014 With deer breeding season beginning in October and running through mid-December, motorists are being warned to watch for white tails on the road. TJ Jefferson of Grants Automotive in Easton says his shop sees a clear spike: \u201cIt is about 20% to 30% more this time of year. I get more calls early in the morning, \u2018Can you come get my car? I just struck a deer or a deer just struck me.\u2019\u201d State Farm data show U.S. drivers filed an estimated 1.8 million animal-collision claims from July 2022 to June 2023, with about 1.5 million deer-car accidents annually causing more than $1 billion in insured losses; Maryland drivers face a 1-in-116 risk.\n\nTrooper Ian Rola of the Easton Barracks explained the seasonal surge: \u201cThe incidents that rise this time of year are car accidents. (Deer) are in rut and are running all over and crossing the roadway. It is usually up this time of year \u2014 in the November time frame.\u201d To keep roads clear, \u201cIt is between law enforcement and SHA. We try to keep the roads clear. We rely on the public. If you see a carcass, give us a call, and we will come out. If it is a mess, we call SHA (State Highway Administration) to help,\u201d Rola said, urging drivers to slow down and buckle up: \u201cYou have got to imagine, you hit a deer, you slam on the brakes and you are going forward at the same time. The seat belt will stop that forward momentum. This saves a lot of injuries from deer accidents.\u201d\n\nState Highway Administration representative Charlie Gischlar cautioned against evasive swerves: \u201cMaking sudden, sharp turns is dangerous as it could place the driver in the path of oncoming traffic or cause your vehicle to strike a fixed object such as a tree or utility pole.\u201d",

After walking between two rows of saluting officers, Wood slid into a patrol car and radioed, \"I'm off duty \u2014 and retired.\"\n\nCecil County Executive Adam Streight, who had retired from the Sheriff's Office less than two months earlier, presented Wood with a county proclamation. Streight noted, \"There is no other job like police work. It is who you are.\" Wood traced his own calling to childhood: \"Ever since I was a kid, I wanted to be a police officer. That's all I ever wanted to be. I wanted to be able to help people.\"\n\nWood, 40-year veteran corporal and firearms instructor, spent 25 years with North East PD and over 20 with the Cecil County Sheriff's Office. \"You could count on Cpl. Wood to take extra shifts and to do whatever needed to be done. He also was great as a community liaison for the department, working with the homeowners associations,\" said NEPD Chief Stephen Yates. A dispatcher closed the radio tribute with, \"We thank Cpl. Wood's wife, Lou, and his family for sharing him with us for 46 years. Cpl. Wood, thank you for all you have done to make Cecil County a better place . . . Enjoy your camping trips and cutting firewood.\"",

    "content": "An Oxford man is facing multiple charges after allegedly pointing a loaded shotgun at someone following an argument. Robert McWilliams, 63, is charged with first-and second-degree assault, using a firearm in a crime of violence, reckless endangerment and intoxicated endangerment in connection to a Sunday, Aug. 6, incident.\n\nDeputies from the Talbot County Sheriff's Office responded to the 100 block of Third Street in Oxford just after 10 p.m. that day for a reported assault in progress. According to charging documents, the caller, a family member, said McWilliams had a shotgun and had threatened to shoot him. The threat followed an argument between the two men at a local restaurant earlier that evening.\n\nAfter leaving the restaurant with the rest of his family, the man said they walked to McWilliams' house and knocked on his door. The man told police McWilliams came to the door armed with a shotgun, pointed it at him and said that, if the man entered the home, he would shoot him.\n\nPolice who spoke with McWilliams at the home said they could smell the odor of alcohol on his breath and on him. McWilliams told police that he left the restaurant after the argument and returned home. When he heard the man knock at the door, he armed himself with the shotgun and went downstairs to answer. McWilliams also told police he did not point the shotgun at the man and that he felt \"threatened\" by something the man said earlier in the evening.\n\nPolice recovered the shotgun, identified as a Remington 870 20-gauge. The gun was found with one live shot shell in the chamber with the safety off, police wrote in charging documents. McWilliams appeared in the county district court Aug.7 for a bail review. He was ordered to remain held without bond. A preliminary hearing in the case is scheduled for Aug.28.",

    "content": "A Facebook video showing federal agents in ski masks and bulletproof vests arresting four men on Maryland Avenue in Cambridge on June 4 has ignited fear in local immigrant communities. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s definitely something we knew was coming, but we didn\u2019t know it was gonna be handled this way,\u201d said Julie Martinez, who recorded and uploaded the footage around 7:15 a.m. after seeing four unmarked cars surround a work truck. \u201cAs you can see in the video, they didn\u2019t even give them time at all to even explain or say why you\u2019re getting pulled over,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cIt was very quick, so when I saw it, my first thing was \u2018oh my gosh, there\u2019s no way this is happening.\u2019\u201d Agents\u2019 vests only said \u201cPolice,\u201d and the Department of Homeland Security has not responded to inquiries; Cambridge police and the Dorchester County sheriff said they had no prior knowledge.  \n\nImmigration attorney Matthew Famiglietti, who has practiced for more than 25 years, said the legal landscape has shifted rapidly under the Trump administration: \u201cTalking about what\u2019s legal and what\u2019s not legal, that\u2019s changed quite a bit since Trump.\u201d ICE arrests are up 25 % since inauguration day, driven by five executive orders that ended safe-space protections for churches, courts, hospitals and schools. Famiglietti urged families searching for detained relatives to \u201ccall their senators and representatives for information. That\u2019s the No. 1 thing.\u201d  \n\nNationwide \u201cNo King Day\u201d protests against the administration\u2019s immigration policies are scheduled for June 14, with demonstrations planned in both Easton and Cambridge. Martinez advised immigrants to \u201cDrive at the speed limit. Do everything you\u2019re supposed to be doing,\u201d adding, \u201cYou know we contribute to this country a lot, and unfortunately, we can\u2019t stay home. We can\u2019t do much but to keep going forward, but definitely stay more on the low.\u201d",

    "content": "CASA of the Mid-Shore, a private, nonprofit organization, advocates for children under the protection of the Talbot, Dorchester, Queen Anne's or Kent Circuit Courts because of abuse, neglect or abandonment to ensure the children's right to thrive in safe, permanent homes. A CASA volunteer's role is unique. As a caring and consistent adult, CASA volunteers attempt to identify the specific needs of each child, advocate in court and with agency partners for services to meet those needs and assist in seeking a permanent resolution for each child's life as quickly and safely as possible.\n\nMost importantly, the CASA gets to know their appointed children, often becoming one of the most consistent adults in children's lives. This is especially poignant during the holiday season, when all children need to know that someone cares and is looking out for them. For many children, the holidays are a time for building happy memories with family. However, holidays can be very difficult for children who have been removed from their homes and placed in foster care. Rather than enjoying the magic of the season, these children may be adjusting to new foster homes and transitioning to new schools. That can be a heavy burden, and CASA volunteers can help by being present for the children.\n\nCASA's involvement can lead to children's hope for a better tomorrow. Studies support the fact that children and youth with CASA volunteers have higher levels of hope than foster children who do not have CASA in their lives. Greater hope can lead to children being more likely to succeed in school, having greater self-control, increased optimism and a healthier sense of well-being. \"Speaking up for children is our proverbial North Star. It guides us in the certainty that a better future is a real possibility for each child we serve,\" said Robin Davenport, CASA's executive director. \"As we enter the holiday season, we are filled with gratitude for our CASA volunteers. Their compassionate dedication to vulnerable children is a treasure in our service region.\"\n\nCASA volunteers come from all walks of life, varied experiences and professions, and are at least 21 years of age. After completing the application and screening process, individuals participate in pre-service training before being sworn in as an officer of the court. CASA welcomes volunteers from all cultures, ethnicities and backgrounds. To learn more about becoming a Court Appointed Special Advocate, visit casamidshore.org or email jc@casamidshore.org.",

Nihjay Greene, 18, of Trappe, and Aamad Turner, 19, of Easton, were charged at the end of 2024 for their alleged involvement in multiple vehicle break-ins and thefts that occurred at the end of December in the La Trappe Heights community in Trappe.\n\nOn Monday, the state entered nolle prosequi for all of Greene and Turner's charges in the district court. \"This means the state will not prosecute for those charges.\" In an interview Monday, Talbot County State's Attorney Joseph Coale said the charges against Greene and Turner will be recharged in the Talbot County Circuit Court. Coale said this process is standard practice for more complex district court cases that move to the circuit court.\n\nThe charges stem from an incident on Dec. 30 where deputies responded to a report of an attempted vehicle break-in in the 3800 block of Seymour Drive in Trappe. According to a Jan. 3 news release from the Talbot County Sheriff's Office, deputies determined after further investigation that \"three men wearing all black clothing and masks attempted to enter multiple vehicles, stealing various items.\" Police said the same day, deputies were dispatched to Harrison Circle in Trappe, where a resident noticed three men dressed in black clothing and wearing masks looking into vehicles.\n\nPolice said the three men barricaded themselves in a residence in the 3900 block of Main Street and after a short time, deputies were able to make contact with them. Police identified the three men as Greene, Turner and a 16-year-old boy, who was not named by the sheriff's office. The Sheriff's Office said Greene attempted to resist arrest and assaulted a deputy as he was being detained. According to the news release, deputies found evidence during the investigation that also connected the three teens to vehicle break-ins that occurred in Easton earlier in 2024.",

He was granted bond Tuesday, family told The Baltimore Banner. ICE stated Espinal, an Honduran national, \u201centered the United States on a 6-month visa and never left in 24 years,\u201d calling it \u201ca federal crime to overstay the authorized period of time granted under a visitors visa.\u201d Espinal, in the country since 2001 with no criminal record, according to his family, had his arrest spark regional outcry and weekly Easton protests.",

    "date": "2025-03-13",
    "author": "SASHA ALLEN Capital News Service",
    "content": "Maryland lawmakers are clashing over two competing prison-reform bills this session. The Maryland Second Look Act, sponsored by Democrat Del. Cheryl Pasteur of Baltimore County, would let people who have served at least 20 years petition courts for sentence reductions if they show sustained good behavior. \"They have done every single thing possible to be better folks, better than a lot of the folks that I work with here,\" Pasteur said, adding, \"When do we ever have to spend 20 years to be vetted? Never.\"\n\nRepublican Sen. William Folden of Frederick County is pushing the opposite approach with his Real Time for Violent Crimes bill, which would bar or limit diminution credits for violent offenders. \"If you commit a violent crime and you prey on our communities, and you're that two percenters that are the worst of the worst, then you should get real time and not allow it to be watered down through dim credits and things of that,\" Folden said. Kurt Wolfgang, executive director of the Maryland Crime Victims Resource Center, called the measure \"long overdue,\" arguing, \"There are so many ways to already diminish a sentence in Maryland. This is just one more hole in the bucket that needs to be plugged up by taking away or diminishing the use of diminution credits to release violent offenders.\"\n\nBoth proposals drew emotional testimony in February and March hearings. Theresa Darvish, whose son was murdered in 2021, opposed retroactive sentence review: \"My son will never return to his home. No murderer should be given a free ride home.\" She labeled the Second Look procedures \"rampant and ambiguous at best.\"\n\nSupporters countered with stories of transformation. Anthony Muhummad, released under the Juvenile Restoration Act after 29 years on two homicide charges, testified, \"There are dozens of individuals who are still incarcerated throughout the Maryland prison system who have served 20, 30, 40 and yes, sometimes even 50 years of incarceration who are not juveniles, who have demonstrated their maturity and rehabilitation and we believe are worthy of a second opportunity.\" Pasteur, a former city school educator who counts two formerly incarcerated students among her \"very favorite,\" said, \"It's about appreciating and recognizing that some folks under the most horrific circumstances have made themselves better. Much better than a whole lot of us on any given day.\"",

It\u2019s a little frustrating when these events are not going through the public assembly event process, to allow us to plan.\u201d\n\nThe rally\u2014one of thousands nationwide against the Trump administration\u2014drew an estimated 800-1,200 people and coincided with an 11:30 a.m.\u20135 p.m. mass-casualty training exercise at Temple B\u2019nai Israel.  \n\u201cWe were able to respond to a call here or there, but if something happened, at that point, it comes at the expense of all the other citizens in the town because we have no officers available to respond to other emergencies,\u201d Lowrey said, noting the patrol division was \u201cessentially wiped out.\u201d\n\nTown code already mandates permits for \u201cany open air public meeting, rally, conference, assembly or similar gathering,\u201d but Lowrey said the wording should be clarified so protests like No Kings\u2014neither Saturday\u2019s nor June\u2019s obtained permits\u2014must apply. Permits cost $100 plus added fees if extra police or equipment are required; police review and the council approves.\n\nTalbot County Democratic Central Committee Chair Phil Jackson, whose group co-organized the rally, said local planners are willing to comply.  \n\u201cWe are very interested in ensuring that these events comply with local policy,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cShould the Town of Easton move forward with changes to their public gathering permits, we will look to comply with those and follow the process.\u201d\n\nLowrey stressed the goal is preparedness, not cost: the department usually covers events with on-duty officers at no charge.  \n\u201cBut when you have 800 to 1,200 people lining streets and stuff, things can go wrong very quickly,\u201d he warned. \u201cAnd that\u2019s always my biggest fear. It takes a car driving through 30 people, and we have a mass casualty, actually, incident, and not an exercise.\u201d",

Greg Gannon, co-operator of C.H.

We recognize that building a state-of-the-art hospital to replace an aging and outdated facility may cause inconveniences and have worked tirelessly with state, county and city officials to ensure interruptions to daily activities are minimized. The necessary decision for a temporary closure of Route 662 was made in conjunction with the State Highway Administration, Talbot County officials and the Talbot County Sheriff\u2019s Office.\u201d\n\nNearly 70 residents wrote the Talbot County Council opposing a land-transfer bill that removes a 2013 requirement for a replacement road before closure; the council approved it 4-1, with Lynn Mielke dissenting. Wittman resident Mark Marshall, who signed the letter, said: \u201cIt\u2019s going to put a hardship on a lot of people who basically depend on that road, especially on weekends with the traffic and everything going to and from Easton.\u201d He added: \u201cIf you have to go down (Route) 50, you\u2019re taking your life in your own hands.\u201d\n\nThe Maryland State Highway Administration, which must approve the state-road closure, stated: \u201cSHA continues to work with all involved parties and will review the proposed detour plan to ensure it meets standards and provides for a safe alternate route.\u201d",

According to court documents, just after 7:30 a.m. that morning, police met with a woman who said her car was hit three times by a tractor-trailer going eastbound on Route 50 at the Dover Road intersection. She said she was stopped at the intersection's red light.\n\nThe woman told police that the tractor-trailer hit her rear bumper once, reversed and hit her car again and then struck her car for a third time, according to court records. The tractor-trailer driver, later identified as Dziergowski, continued driving when the light turned green and did not attempt to stop, the woman told police. Easton police wrote in charging documents that \"dispatch (had) received several calls in reference to the same tractor trailer driving all over the roadway.\"\n\nThe Talbot County Sheriff's Office and Cambridge Police Department stopped the tractor-trailer stopped on Route 50 in Cambridge. Easton police arrived on scene and arrested Dziergowski around 8:30 a.m. Dziergowski was released on his own recognizance Thursday. A preliminary hearing in Talbot County District Court is set for Sept. 16.",

Plugging them into a power strip is just asking for trouble,\u201d the article states, adding that these tools \u201cmust be plugged directly into a wall outlet \u2013 preferably one with a ground-fault circuit interrupter breaker to avoid danger should those tools accidentally be exposed to water.\u201d\n\nRefrigerators, freezers, toasters, toaster ovens, microwaves and space heaters are also singled out. \u201cThese appliances pull too much current for a power strip because they are continuously cycling on and off. That will quickly overload a power strip,\u201d the piece notes, stressing that \u201cthese items need to be plugged directly into a wall outlet dedicated solely to that appliance.\u201d\n\nToasters are flagged because \u201cit has exposed wires inside those slots that heat up to become red-hot. It takes a lot of current to fire up those wires, which can easily overload a power strip. So, no, do not plug your toaster into an extension cord or power strip. Ditto for your toaster oven.\u201d\n\nMicrowaves demand \u201cmore energy than what a power strip can deliver,\u201d and space heaters pose a special risk: \u201cMost portable heaters consume 1,500 watts of energy on their high settings. Connect one to a power strip and it becomes potentially hazardous due to allowing them to run for an extended period.\u201d",

The Brotherhood of the Fire Services is pretty tight. When we see someone in need, then we want to be able to help any way we can.\u201d After the department recently received a new ambulance and fire truck, Norbury spread word through the Maryland State Firefighters Association; Bill Killan of a Tennessee department soon coordinated a drop-off site in Butler, Tennessee.\n\nOxford Fire President Tim Kearns and three other drivers took turns on the 500-plus-mile haul, making two key deliveries. The first, in Bristol, Virginia, handed off \u201ca skid brush unit, which is a pre-assembled piece of equipment that can fit into the back of a pickup truck and turn that pickup truck into a brush truck for fighting land fires and small house fires\u201d\u2014vital because \u201cthe roads in the area were so badly destroyed that any vehicle would have a difficult time navigating through.\u201d The second stop was Faith Camp, a campground owned by Darren Clark of the Elk Mills Poga (Fla.) Volunteer Fire Department, who has turned the property into a satellite fire station for displaced residents.\n\nMaryland departments in Oxford, Tilghman, Cordova, Easton, Queen Anne Hillsboro, Suddlersville and Hollywood contributed. \u201cIt took a lot of folks to coordinate and manhandle the transfer of this equipment, from the paperwork, insurances, transfer of titles and tags, to all of the logistics here, there and in between,\u201d Kearns noted, crediting Chief Engineer Stacy Dulin and Assistant Chief Engineers Mike Greenwak and Tom Bixler for readying the gear, and Oxford Ferry for lending the heavy trailer.",

Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) said the party will pursue only minor tweaks. \u201cI think we're going to have a cannabis bill this year that sort of does some \u2014 I don't want to call it cleanup \u2014 but adjustments to the system that we passed last year,\u201d Ferguson stated. \u201cI don't think you'll see major changes to the program, but implementation adjustments.\u201d\n\nThe law, backed by the Legislative Black Caucus, was enacted last year to curb unwarranted searches disproportionately affecting people of color. Critics contend it hampers policing. \u201cThe irony is, if we see someone chugging a beer, police can pull them over,\u201d said Sen. William Folden (R-Frederick), a legislator and police officer. He argued the statute removes probable cause \u201cjust because you're saying, well, you're not allowed to use your nose anymore.\u201d\n\nAfter voters legalized adult-use cannabis, the General Assembly crafted licensing, taxation, and equity rules. Del. Jheanelle Wilkins (D-Montgomery), Black Caucus chair and odor-law sponsor, said the measures were meant to address \u201cthe harms of the past when it comes to criminalization of cannabis.\u201d Sen. Jack Bailey (R-Calvert, St. Mary\u2019s) countered, \u201cThe public clearly wanted marijuana legalized, fine, but we shouldn't do away with the requirements.\u201d\n\nDemocratic leaders reiterated that only small administrative changes\u2014such as refining the Maryland Cannabis Administration\u2019s structure\u2014are on the table. \u201cIt was hugely complicated, lots of moving pieces for the cannabis bill last year,\u201d Ferguson noted. Wilkins added the caucus is \u201cworking closely with the administration to make sure that our intentions of the bill are carried out.\u201d",

Wes Moore on Tuesday signed the Maryland Road Worker Protection Act, a measure his administration calls \u201ca moral imperative\u201d that lets work zones deploy multiple speed cameras and, effective June 1, raises the base fine for speed-camera violations to $80; beginning in January 2025 fines will range from $60 to $500 depending on speed and will double when workers are present. Lt. Gov. Aruna Miller, a former transportation engineer, said the law was inspired by two fatal incidents: \u201cWe saw it happen on March 22, 2023. And we saw it happen again on March 26, 2024. It\u2019s a moral imperative that we protect workers who provide critical service, public service for all of us.\u201d\n\nAlso signed was the PORT Act, amended in the session\u2019s final hours to create the Fallen Transportation Workers Scholarship Program, offering up to five years of full-time or eight years of part-time tuition aid to children and spouses of transportation workers who have died on the job since 2022. \u201cCertainly, we wish there were no one participating in that fund, but sadly, we know how dangerous this work is,\u201d said Senate President Bill Ferguson.

Town Engineer Rick Van Emburgh said the forthcoming manual, with guidelines to be overlaid on a town map in November, \u201cwill make it easier for the town to require certain road safety steps be taken when residential or commercial developers apply for site plan approval,\u201d and predicted the town will be \u201cless likely to give developers breaks or reliefs from ensuring private roads are up to town standards.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a very practical document that I can think of a lot of different ways it will be used,\u201d Van Emburgh said of the Complete Streets study.\n\nSpecific trouble spots dominated the hour-long discussion. Council President Don Abbatiello, joined by Councilmembers Maureen Curry and the Rev. Elmer Davis, complained that telephone poles mid-sidewalk on Port Street endanger walkers. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna (be) awfully difficult to make Port Street pedestrian friendly unless we make some serious improvements,\u201d Curry said. North Washington Street is already slated for sidewalks; survey and design money is budgeted for the stretch from Easton Hardware to Gay\u2019s Seafood, and the Complete Streets guidance will dictate final bike, pedestrian and vehicular details.\n\nThe broader debate flared after a recent fatal bicycle crash on state-controlled Route 50. Ward 3 Councilmember David Montgomery warned, \u201cAutomobile transportation is pretty much what everybody uses in order to get into the center of town. So I\u2019m very concerned about our sacrificing the flow of single-occupancy vehicles, sacrificing it to other things, that for my ward, don\u2019t do any good at all by way of mobility,\u201d noting many older west-side residents \u201caren\u2019t interested in bicycling to downtown.\u201d Talbot Thrive Executive Director Heather Grant countered that residents who \u201cdon\u2019t want to drive everywhere\u201d deserve \u201cequal access to safe infrastructure,\u201d adding, \u201cSome council members who mention the difficulties in traveling by car during school drop off and pick up should consider that if we make our streets safer for kids to walk and bike to school, we can reduce vehicle congestion.\u201d",

Dyott, from Easton, had been with the department since December doing ride-alongs while preparing to become a full-time officer.\n\n\"Ever since I was little, I wanted to be a cop,\" Dyott said. \"But when I got out of high school, you can't be a cop until you're 21. So, when I got out of high school, I thought, 'I'll join Talbot County Corrections.' That way in corrections, it teaches you how to talk to people, interact with the people. Just because they got locked up and you see them in the jail, you realize they're not a bad person. They're just people like us.\"\n\nThe 21-year-old previously worked two years as a Talbot County correctional officer. Now completing his required 240 hours of field training, Dyott has enjoyed meeting the community and wants residents to know \"I'm going to be fair, 100%. I believe in respect goes a long way. You respect me, I'm going to respect you anytime\u2026 No matter what, I'm going to be fair, and I'm going to try to step up on community policing.\"\n\n\"We're proud to welcome Officer Dyott to our department,\" Lt. Michelle Schuerholz said. \"Being so young, he brings a strong commitment to community and public safety, and we're confident he will be a great asset to both our department and the residents we serve. We look forward to seeing the positive impact Officer Dyott will make in our community. He comes from correctional, and he had a good reputation there, and I think he'll do well here.\"",

Appearing by closed-circuit TV from the Cecil County Detention Center, Randle heard Assistant State\u2019s Attorney Gavin Patashnick argue: \u201cThe state cannot think of any (allegations) more heinous . . .\u201d Patashnick added that Randle\u2014who has family in Indiana and no local ties\u2014poses a flight risk, and noted that \u201cBoth governors in Delaware and Maryland signed the agreement. She must go back to Delaware immediately (after the adjudication of her Cecil County murder case).\u201d\n\nRandle is charged with first-degree murder and 10 related counts in the June 9 beating death of her 3-year-old daughter, Nola Dinkins, inside the Elk Nest Road home of her boyfriend, Cedrick Antoine Britten, 44. Court records say Randle confessed to striking Nola \u201c15 to 20 times with a belt all over her body,\u201d causing the child to collapse and stop breathing, then asked Britten to dispose of the body in a dark blue suitcase. Britten, also held without bond, allegedly provided a map that led police to human remains \u201cconsistent with an emaciated child\u201d in a nearby vacant lot; the remains were positively identified as Nola\u2019s. After the killing, Randle falsely reported a kidnapping near Newark, Del., triggering an Amber Alert; she must return to Delaware to face a felony false-report charge once her Maryland case concludes.\n\nDefense attorney Michael Halter told the judge that Randle \u201cvehemently denies the allegations\u201d and \u201clooks forward to her day in court.\u201d",

The Merlini called in an engine failure before crashing into the river at around 9:30 a.m., the Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement to The Star Democrat. The pilot was the only person on board.\n\nMerlini was doing work with the Maryland Advanced Development Laboratory's University Research Foundation, according to officials at the scene. \"It's a sad day for not only the aviation community, but for the scientific community,\" said David Abrams, the communication director for the Maryland Department of the Environment. According to David Heidhausen, president at the University Research Foundation, the plane was used for advanced research and development. Heidhausen said the projects included enhanced flight vision systems, cameras in the nose and helmet-mounted displays. Heidhausen said Merlini was not developing research but relocating the plane in a \"ferry flight\" when he crashed.\n\nAccording to a preliminary investigation, the aircraft took off shortly before 9 a.m. from Tipton Airport at Fort Meade before crashing into the Tred Avon River, MSP said. Police believe the pilot was headed toward the Easton Airport when the crash occurred. Liz Underhill, who lives along the Tred Avon, received a call from a neighbor who had seen the plane in the water. Underhill got in her boat and attempted to assess the situation. She saw the plane in the water, but no one was out of the plane. There were numerous other people in boats trying to help.",

    "content": "For more than four decades, the Mid-Shore Council on Family Violence has led advocacy for victims on the Mid-Shore, and its new Geographic Information System program now extends help far beyond the region by mapping a free one-stop hub of essential resources.\n\nExecutive director Jeanne Yeager said rural clients face barriers such as limited jobs, spotty cell service, scarce transportation and housing, and geographic isolation; the pandemic made those barriers unmistakable.  \n\"I was really mindful of coming out of COVID, because everything we did at Mid-Shore was very one-on-one, personalized \u2014 our case management, our meetings, our support groups, everything \u2014 and we would say, 'Oh, well, we'll do an online group sometime.' Well, 'that sometime' became tomorrow,\" Yeager said. \"So it normalized using technology, and I think there's no turning back.\"\n\nWhat began as a five-county housing map grew, GIS senior data analyst Kazeem Anifowoshe explained, into a nine-county website now used by 25 agencies and stocked with pro-bono and legal resources through a partnership with Access to Justice.  \n\"When people kind of think of victim services, there's kind of like a formula that a lot of people have been doing for 20 to 40 plus years at their organization that works for them,\" Anifowoshe said. \"But again, we're just trying to make things easier the best way we know how, by mapping things.\"\n\nThe hub, which recently earned the Domestic Shelters Purple Ribbon Award, layers data on housing, childcare, pet care, medical facilities, courts, law enforcement, and social services. Program evaluator Pamela Caudill Jordan hopes the model will push organizations beyond crisis intervention toward long-term survivor stability.\n\nYeager and Anifowoshe aim for wider adoption across Maryland and, eventually, nationwide.  \n\"We know what victims need,\" Yeager said. \"We ought to work with victims, and we're making this available. Let's see where we're going with it.\"",

The apparatus, outfitted with a Cummins L9 engine, Hale QMAX pump, and more than $200,000 of tools and hose, replaced the 2009 Engine 49 as the first-due unit and supplanted the 1990 Engine 48, which after 33 years \u201cexceeded the expected 30-year service window\u201d and is now kept in reserve because \u201cparts for repairs are getting harder to find and the apparatus lacks updated safety features,\u201d according to SMVFD President Chris Thomas.\n\nDesigned by the department\u2019s engine committee and bought through Patriot Fire in Grasonville, the $718,850 rig was funded by \u201ca combination of fundraising efforts and money that we get from the county, town and state,\u201d Thomas said.

    "content": "An American Airlines jet carrying 64 people and an Army Black Hawk helicopter with three soldiers collided late Wednesday while the plane was landing at Ronald Reagan National Airport, leaving no survivors. The wreckage\u2014found upside-down in three sections in waist-deep Potomac water\u2014prompted a switch \u201cfrom a rescue operation to a recovery operation,\u201d said D.C. Fire Chief John Donnelly.\n\nAmong the 67 dead were Alexandr \u201cSasha\u201d Kirsanov, 46, a University of Delaware-affiliated coach, and two of his young pairs-skating students, Sean Kay and Angela Yang, who had just competed at a national development camp in Wichita, Kansas. \u201cOur hearts go out to the families and friends of all of the victims of this horrific tragedy,\u201d UD president Dennis Assanis said. \u201cKirsanov and the skaters trained at the University\u2019s High Performance Training Center\u2026 the training home for many years of multiple world-class skating champions,\u201d he added. UD athletic director Chrissi Rawak said, \u201cHis dedication \u2014 and that of his skaters \u2014 forged meaningful connections throughout the UD family. Coach Kirsanov\u2019s passion and commitment touched many lives, leaving a permanent mark on our campus.\u201d\n\nKirsanov\u2019s wife and fellow coach, Natalya Gudin, told ABC News, \u201cI lost everything. I lost my husband, I lost my students, I lost my friends.\u201d Kay and Yang, partners who won first place at a Texas competition in November, were returning with at least 14 other skaters from the Wichita camp. \u201cIt was a lot of fun watching all the skaters at Kansas,\u201d Yang posted on Instagram three days before the crash. U.S. Figure Skating stated, \u201cWe are heartbroken to learn that figure skaters, along with their families, friends and coaches, are understood to be among those on board.\u201d\n\nDelaware leaders demanded a full investigation. \u201cHere in Delaware, we\u2019re mourning the loss of former University of Delaware Figure Skating coach Sasha Kirsanov, as well as two youth skaters and their family members who were aboard AA5342,\u201d said Gov. Matt Meyer. Sen. Chris Coons added, \u201cI\u2019m devastated to hear the news that at least three Delawareans died during last night\u2019s air collision\u2026 Delaware is a state of neighbors, and tonight we hold all of our neighbors a little closer.\u201d",

Further investigation indicates they were involved in an alleged altercation at the time the incident occurred,\" according to the release. Shortly before 1 p.m. on Monday, Oct. 7, troopers from the Leonardtown barrack responded to Spring Valley Drive and Valley Court in Lexington Park for the report of a pedestrian struck by a Chevrolet Suburban. Upon arrival, troopers located Scarborough with apparent injuries. He was flown by Maryland State Police Aviation Command to MedStar Washington Hospital.

DeWaun McKan, whose required 30-minute security checks never included looking into the cell, \u201cneither checked for pulses nor performed CPR\u201d once the bodies were discovered; he \u201cinstead radio[ed] for help.\u201d King\u2019s family sued McKan and prison administrators under a \u201csupervisory liability\u201d theory, arguing the death resulted from officials\u2019 \u201cdeliberate indifference.\u201d This month the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit \u201caffirmed a district court\u2019s judgment that King\u2019s family cannot sue to hold anyone at the prison responsible,\u201d granting qualified immunity to all defendants. The majority held: \u201cThere is no clearly established constitutional right to properly conducted security checks,\u201d and therefore neither McKan nor others \u201c\u2018knowingly\u2019 disregarded the law.\u201d\n\nJudge James A. Wynn Jr., dissenting, wrote that the \u201catrocity\u201d occurred because \u201ctwo double-murderers could circulate through the prison unit unsupervised,\u201d noting McKan\u2019s checks were \u201crisible\u201d and that \u201che did not notice four corpses during five checks.\u201d Wynn emphasized that the Supreme Court has affirmed \u201can Eighth Amendment duty \u2018to protect prisoners from violence at the hands of other prisoners,\u2019\u201d and that the 4th Circuit itself has said \u201ca prison official cannot hide behind an excuse that he was unaware of a risk, no matter how obvious.\u201d He concluded: \u201cGranting qualified immunity in a \u2018failure-to-protect\u2019 case constitutes permission for lethal neglect,\u201d and warned that \u201cwhen judges, with hairsplitting misapplications of qualified immunity, openly abet governmental malfeasance \u2026 mayhem proliferates, lethally.\u201d",

Juveniles carrying guns and firing upon a parade of innocent civilians should show that this is a crucial conversation to have,\u201d Murphy writes.\n\nCiting agreement with the earlier article \u201cWhy we cannot solve America\u2019s gun problem,\u201d Murphy contends, \u201cI agree that in Missouri there needs to be better gun safety laws such as background checks and permits to carry. A requirement to lock up firearms countrywide is essential in a household because juveniles like this can get guns from family members.\u201d He criticizes political alliances that block reform: \u201cI agree that it is an issue that one party has made an agreement with the National Rifle Association, and they have their bias toward it. Opposing criminal background checks does not seem safe or smart in any capacity. Some lawmakers change and alter their ideals purposefully to receive votes.\u201d\n\nMurphy adds he does not seek an outright ban\u2014\u201cI do not think guns should be completely outlawed and banned. I think everyone should have the right to own a firearm barring obvious constraints such as mental illness or a criminal record\u201d\u2014but insists, \u201cHowever, there absolutely needs to be background checks across the country and ensuring that guns in the house are locked up and out of reach from children.\u201d",

Mendez Tomas, 17, is facing first-and second-degree assault and reckless endangerment charges in connection to the incident Thursday evening.\n\nOfficers from the Easton Police Department were dispatched to the John Ford Park just after 6:30 p.m. Thursday for an assault. After arriving, police found a 46-year-old woman who was bleeding heavily from a laceration on her forehead sitting on a bench in the park. The woman told police that she was walking the Rails to Trails when she saw Mendez urinating in the woods. The woman told police that she did not pay attention to the teen and continued walking. But as she was walking, she heard footsteps coming from behind her. When she turned around, she was repeatedly struck in the head with a rock by Mendez, police said.\n\nPolice said Mendez took the woman to the ground when she started to scream for help. The woman told police that as she screamed, Mendez ran down the trail traveling south. About an hour and a half later, as officers were canvassing the Rails to Trails looking for a suspect, police found Mendez on the trail at South Street. Officers noticed that the teen matched the description of the suspect and had blood on his clothing. Police said Mendez was released to the custody of the Talbot County Detention Center.",

Ross learned Rider \u201chad been voluntarily admitted to Johns Hopkins Hospital\u201d and issued a bench warrant for his failure to appear Monday morning. The trial, originally set for March 4, 2024, has been tentatively rescheduled for Aug. 19 at 9 a.m., according to the Maryland Electronic Courts website.\n\nRider\u2019s attorney, Stephanie Shipley, filed a motion Friday requesting the postponement, stating Rider had been admitted to Johns Hopkins Hospital \u201con an emergency basis for acute medical issues, with further transfer planned to an inpatient facility in the State of Maryland.\u201d The State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office consented on the condition of \u201cfurther appropriate medical documentation,\u201d and Shipley presented an updated letter from the hospital at Monday\u2019s status hearing. Once Rider is released, the bench warrant can be executed; his $20,000 unsecured bond, posted in February 2023, was revoked.\n\nThe charges stem from a Nov. 24, 2022, fire at 27930 Peach Orchard Road in Easton. Deputy State Fire Marshal Shayne McKinney wrote that a Talbot County deputy indicated Rider \u201chad possibly attempted suicide that evening based on evidence found within the home,\u201d noting Rider \u201chad attempted suicide in the past as well.\u201d A person connected to Rider told investigators Rider \u201chad clearly indicated to him that he was attempting suicide and wanted to be left alone,\u201d and that Rider said \u201che lit the house on fire\u201d during their phone conversation. Officials classified the blaze as incendiary, and court documents state Rider\u2019s actions \u201cclearly\u201d endangered more than 45 responding firefighters. Rider was arrested in February 2023 and in April 2023 entered a plea of not criminally responsible by reason of insanity.",

He was pronounced dead at about 2:06 p.m., the town said. EMS then placed two sheets over the man, preventing him from being viewed by the public.\n\nThe forensic investigator arrived on the scene at about 4:30 p.m., then they consulted the medical examiner's office in Baltimore that an autopsy would be needed. The forensic investigator contacted Springbok to transport the body to the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in Baltimore. The estimated time of arrival was initially an hour and a half, but due to a 16-mile Bay Bridge back-up, the transport was delayed and didn't arrive until 7 p.m.\n\n\"EMS, the forensic investigator and the Greensboro Police Department offered to moved the man out of the environment, back inside the residence or place him in a body bag. The family declined all options,\" the town said.",

Officers gave warnings for the subject to stop as they were attempting to retreat.\u201d Police said the man continued to approach, and one officer fired multiple times. \u201cOfficers immediately rendered life saving measures to the subject awaiting EMS arrival,\u201d the release said. \u201cAfter EMS arrived, the subject was transported to the University of Maryland Shore Medical Center at Cambridge prior to being flown by Maryland State Police Aviation to Tidal Health Peninsula Regional Medical Center in Salisbury,\u201d where he later died.\n\nCambridge Police Chief Justin Todd confirmed three officers were present and said this is the city\u2019s first fatal police shooting in roughly 15 years. The officer who discharged their weapon has been placed on paid administrative leave while the Maryland attorney general\u2019s Independent Investigations Division conducts the state-mandated probe. Todd said press releases and body-worn camera footage will be released \u201cas part of the transparency process.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the main thing I want to say is my condolences to the family of the subject that succumbed to his injuries. Unfortunately, it's a sad situation,\u201d Todd said. \u201cAnd speaking with some of the family, I just feel there needs to be thoughts and prayers kept for them as well.\u201d Neither the deceased man nor the involved officer has been publicly identified.",

    "content": "Maryland\u2019s Department of Juvenile Services will move girls awaiting court or long-term placement from a single unit at the boys-only Cheltenham Youth Detention Center to the Western Maryland Children\u2019s Center in Hagerstown later this month, where all girls in the agency\u2019s residential care will eventually be housed. The shift follows Juvenile Justice Monitoring Unit reports that four moves of detained girls\u2014and one of committed girls\u2014between March and October 2022 \u201cdisrupted school, led to longer and more frequent periods of confinement and isolation, delayed medical services and exposed girls to sexual harassment.\u201d\n\nInvestigators documented the fallout: \u201cThey just treat these girls like chattel, moving them constantly from one place to another without thinking of how it will impact them,\u201d a staffer said in early 2023. A mental-health therapist added, \u201cThey are just replicating the streets here, it\u2019s like survival every day,\u201d noting the Victor Cullen Center was too \u201cshort-handed\u201d to provide treatment. A 19-year-old at Cullen told an investigator, \u201cThere is nothing treatment-oriented about this program.\u201d\n\nThe revolving-door placements began when DJS closed the Thomas J.S. Waxter Children\u2019s Center in March 2022, moved girls to the refurbished Alfred D. Noyes center, then shuttled them twice more after a fire and a staffing crisis. At Cheltenham, girls were barred from the infirmary, endured 23-hour cell isolation during a COVID outbreak, and faced harassment: two girls reported in early 2023 that a boy \u201cmoved his hand over his crotch and told the girls to perform a sexual favor.\u201d One girl said, \u201cIt\u2019s so crazy here. It\u2019s so hard to concentrate in school because it is so loud, and loud noises are my trigger,\u201d while a pregnant girl who was assaulted twice stated, \u201cMe and my child feel threatened.\u201d JJMU concluded, \u201cRelegating detained girls and young women to a single unit in a secure detention facility set up to serve boys and young men \u2026 demonstrates a casual disregard for the well-being of girls in DJS custody.\u201d\n\nDJS says WMCC staff are being trained in \u201cgender-responsive programming and trauma-informed care,\u201d but advocates remain skeptical. \u201cWe would prefer that the girls not be incarcerated in the first place,\u201d said advocate Moroney, \u201cbut \u2026 having their own place is a better situation than being shoehorned into a boys\u2019 place.\u201d",

Local lore holds that the ancient Tocobaga Native Americans placed a protective blessing over the bay, reinforced in 1539 when Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto christened it \u201cBahia Espiritu Santo \u2014 Bay of the Holy Spirit.\u201d Tampa has not taken a direct strike since 1921, and many residents cite storms that suddenly veer away.\n\nAs the Category-4 system\u2014packing 155-mph winds\u2014barrels toward Florida for an early-Thursday landfall, forecast models show the center coming ashore south of Tampa Bay, possibly near or below Sarasota. That track would spare the region the worst surge, though Tampa, St. Petersburg and Pinellas County remain in the cone for \u201chigh winds, power outages, possible tornadoes, thunderstorms and downpours.\u201d\n\nThe legend still resonates. \u201cI kind of believe it,\u201d said Kristen Hendry, who lives in Brandon near Tampa. \u201cI\u2019ve seen weird things happen with other hurricanes. Storms will turn.\u201d Faith is not stopping preparations: \u201cWe\u2019re definitely getting ready,\u201d she said. On Monday, St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Cathedral\u2019s Fr.

Labastida received 25 years with all but eight suspended for first-degree assault, 10 years with all but five suspended for use of a firearm in a violent crime, and a fully suspended five-year term for first-degree conspiracy to escape; he will get credit for one year already served and must serve five years of supervised probation.\n\nJudge Karen Dean imposed conditions that include mental-health and substance-abuse evaluations and treatment, abstention from alcohol and drugs, staying away from the Cambridge facility, and no contact with Jeter. Dean said she was \u201ctaken aback\u201d by the state\u2019s \u201clenient\u201d recommendation of five years without parole, adding, \u201calthough I feel for Labastida's family and the pain they have been going through, I also feel for the people that were at the psychiatric facility on the day of the escape.\u201d\n\nProsecutors said Labastida shot into a window several times, kicked out the glass with Jeter\u2014who has schizophrenia and was committed to the hospital\u2014and fled in a black vehicle; Jeter was caught the next day in Montgomery County and later sentenced to 10 years with eight suspended. Evidence of an escape plan was uncovered during the investigation.\n\nDefense attorney Marvin Ochoa told the court Labastida \u201cis sorry for his actions and is ashamed and embarrassed,\u201d withdrew from family in middle school and \u201cstarted hanging out with the \u2018wrong\u2019 crew,\u201d and when he helped with the escape \u201chis brain wasn't fully developed and didn't realize the consequences of his actions, including the \u2018pain and suffering\u2019 it would cause his family.\u201d Ochoa added Labastida has \u201ca lot to give to this world\u201d and \u201cjust needs guidance and support.\u201d\n\nLabastida told Judge Dean, \u201cThere was no reason for me to do what I did on Aug. 1 2023, but there is also no reason for my life to be \u2018stunted.\u2019 I believe I can be a productive member of society.\u201d His mother, Patricia Sanchez, said, \u201cHe has learned a lesson,\u201d and lamented, \u201cWe should (have been) getting ready to go to a graduation or something else, not to this.\u201d His brother Nicholas Sanchez said Labastida \u201cis a hard worker and that with the right guidance, he can become a productive member of society.\u201d",

Groff was found not guilty of two counts each of first- and second-degree rape, third- and fourth-degree sex offense, plus one count each of second-degree assault and false imprisonment.\n\nAccording to a September news release from the Cambridge Police Department, investigators spoke with a woman in the hospital on Aug. 16 who reported that on Aug. 13, a man engaged in conversation with her at a gas station. The woman reportedly told police that she and the man went to a Cambridge residence and he made \"lewd comments and advancements\" on her. Police said the woman reported that she told the man \"no\" and \"stop,\" but the man ended up \"overpowering\" her and she was raped.

He spread joy through the school,\u201d one Kenmore Elementary teacher said, while an administrator recalled, \u201cHe had a bright smile. He hugged people. And he always showed students and teachers affection.\u201d A Kenmore administrator added, \u201cHe was a wonderful big brother to his sister. He walked her to her classroom every day,\u201d and a teacher remembered, \u201cI remember how friendly and outgoing he was.\u201d\n\nSpirit Life Ministries\u2019 Rev. Moneira Hawkins told Tuesday\u2019s crowd, \u201cMesiah was only here 11 years, but he touched a lot of lives \u2014 more than most people do in 50 years,\u201d and urged, \u201cHis spirit is still alive. He touched every one of you.\u201d After crisis counselors spent a busy Monday at Cherry Hill Middle, counselor Joanne Carradin said, \u201cThey had a lot of questions,\u201d and a teacher softly told students, \u201cIt\u2019s OK to feel sad. It\u2019s OK to cry. Take a moment.\u201d\n\nFamily members\u2014mom, dad, stepdad, 8-year-old sister, 15-year-old brother and sisters aged 16 and 20\u2014stood before a memorial of candles, photos, flowers and a football. Mesiah\u2019s 16-year-old sister, who styled his \u201cadorable hairstyles,\u201d said, \u201cI do his hair \u2026 He likes braids, straight backs \u2014 I guess you\u2019d call them cornrows.\u201d His stepdad, recalling kitchen dance sessions and Mesiah\u2019s original rap \u201cI Wish I Had You,\u201d declared, \u201cHe\u2019s a natural. He has a way with words \u2026 That kid was special,\u201d while his dad concluded, \u201cHe was a bright light. When he walked into a room, he lit it up.\u201d",

The Queen Anne's commissioners signed off on Jan. 28, followed by Kent.\n\nQueen Anne's County would own the jail and employ its staff, aiming to absorb current Kent and Caroline correctional officers. \"The agreement has been a collaboration between the three counties for several months,\" Queen Anne's County Administrator Todd Mohn said. Kent Commissioner John Price, who made the motion that passed unanimously, said the facility \"will be built regardless,\" with bed count the main change if Caroline withdraws.\n\nCaroline officials say they still lack precise cost figures. At a recent meeting, Commission Vice President Larry Porter asked, \"Would it make sense for us to engage someone to do an independent evaluation of these operating cost? 'This decision is going to depend on the operational cost and I'm talking long range operational cost,' Porter said.\"\n\nEach county currently runs its own jail, all either over capacity or in need of major renovation; Caroline's facility is about 100 years old. Maryland has pledged to fund up to half of design and construction costs. Queen Anne's Commissioner Phil Dumenil said the regional and state effort \"is a savings for all three counties.\"",

Joan Harris-Brooks, representing Blake-Blackston American Legion Post 77, asked the Easton Town Council on Monday evening to partner with the group so families can honor their loved ones with banners on Ward 4 roads such as Glenwood Avenue, Port Street and West Street.\n\nThe banners cost $200 each, and Harris-Brooks emphasized \"There will be no ask of the council to provide any money for the project.\" She requested the town office hold blank applications for interested families, with additional applications advertised on social media and at Post 77. \"It will instill a sense of pride and unity in Easton and for our country,\" Harris-Brooks told the council. \"It is our goal that you grant us approval. And we believe that if you grant us an approval, this will make a landmark for you as our councilmen.\"\n\nCouncil members unanimously approved the request, expressing hopes the project could extend throughout the town. Ward 4 Council Member the Rev. Elmer Davis said, \"I think that this is a great endeavor. (It's important) that we don't lose the memory of those persons who fought for our country. I believe it's our responsibility to help out with this project. Secondly, it doesn't cost the town a dime.\"\n\nPost 77 will accept donations to help families who cannot afford banners and will work with American Legion Talbot Post 70, Easton Utilities and the town. Harris-Brooks noted, \"I think our children need to be aware. We still have young people still enlisted in the service. I will just very passionately say my uncle was a member of Post 77 \u2026 He gave his ultimate self serving.\"\n\nFollowing approval, Commander Victor Middleton thanked the council: \"When people say thank you for your service, it really lifted me up just now to a higher level. And I thank you all.\"",

    "author": "STAFF REPORT",
    "content": "State transportation officials ordered the MD 405 (Price Station Road) median crossover at U.S. Route 301 in Queen Anne's County closed beginning Saturday, July 26, after two fatal crashes in three days claimed three lives. \"This is a safety-focused decision,\" said State Highway Administrator Will Pines. \"This closure is necessary to save lives and make the corridor safer for the tens of thousands of travelers and residents who use it every day.\"\n\nThe most recent crash occurred around noon on Thursday, July 24, leaving two people dead at the scene. Two days earlier, a woman was killed when her vehicle was struck while crossing Route 301, overturning her car; the other vehicle\u2019s two occupants, a 22-year-old man and a 20-year-old woman, were flown to R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center in critical condition. Between January 2019 and December 2023, the intersection recorded 76 crashes\u201462 in the southbound lanes\u2014mostly due to driver inattention or failure to yield, prompting a previous closure in July 2024 and safety upgrades that failed to curb the toll.\n\nTroopers from the Maryland State Police Centreville Barrack, Queen Anne's County Sheriff Gary Hofmann, and the Church Hill Volunteer Fire Company all support the closure. \"As we did in July of 2024, the department leadership reached out to SHA to ensure emergency access would be available to Fire, EMS, and Police units responding to emergency calls on the east side of Route 301,\" the fire company said, adding, \"We have been assured by SHA leadership that they intend to use the same process as before and that emergency access will be available. While this will create a slight delay in response times, we appreciate the willingness of SHA to work with us to keep those delays as short as possible while long-term solutions for the crossover are worked.\"\n\nSen. Steve Hershey echoed the urgency: \"Given the dangerous track record at this intersection \u2014 and now two fatal accidents in just three days \u2014 it is clear that further action is urgently needed. While I understand the temporary inconvenience to motorists, public safety must come first.\" Emergency vehicle access will be maintained, and alternate crossovers are available at MD 19 (Roberts Station Road) two miles north and Hayden Clark Road 1.7 miles south while the Maryland State Police Crash Team investigates both crashes.",

    "content": "Maryland State Police have charged Darrian Lynelle Randle, of North East, with first- and second-degree murder in the death of her 3-year-old daughter, Nola Dinkins. Her boyfriend, Cedrick Antoine Britten, 44, also of North East, is charged as an accessory and is being held in the Cecil County Detention Center on a $75,000 bond.\n\nDinkins\u2019 body \u2014 described in charging documents as \u201cconsistent with an emaciated child and were completely wrapped in saran (sic) wrap\u201d \u2014 was discovered inside a blue suitcase in the unit block of Dune Drive. Randle and Dinkins had been living in Britten\u2019s Elk Nest Road home, sharing a room, when the alleged crime occurred. Charging documents state Randle beat the child 15\u201320 times Monday with a belt; when the toddler fell and stopped breathing, \u201cRandle stated that Britten attempted CPR ... but eventually realized (Nola Dinkins) was deceased.\u201d\n\nAfterward, \u201cRandle stated that once they returned to the residence she placed (the body) in a dark blue suitcase belonging to Britten,\u201d where it stayed overnight on the basement stairs. Britten later told investigators he removed the suitcase and sent Randle a photo of a park. On Tuesday, Randle falsely reported to New Castle County Police that the child had been kidnapped at gunpoint; while officers searched, Britten showed \u201clittle to no reaction\u201d to news of the missing child. Detectives noticed a strong bleach odor inside the home and recovered blue nitrile gloves in the trash and in the shared bedroom. Dinkins\u2019 body was ultimately located\u2014still in the suitcase\u2014on a vacant lot near Britten\u2019s house.\n\nRandle, held in Delaware on a $1 million bond for filing a false report, now faces Maryland charges including first- and second-degree murder, assault, reckless endangerment, child abuse resulting in death, neglect, failure to report a child death, and unauthorized disposal of a body. Britten is charged with eight counts, among them accessory after the fact to murder, neglect of a minor, unauthorized disposal of a body, and failure to report a child\u2019s death.

Rhett Ritter is facing second-degree rape; second-, third- and fourth-degree sex offenses and second-degree assault charges related to the incident. According to the indictment, the charges stem from a situation involving another minor, which is alleged to have occurred in January 2012 in Ridgely. Ritter was arrested Monday. He was initially ordered held without bond.\n\nAt a bail review Tuesday afternoon, Caroline County State's Attorney Sloane Franklin said he wasn't opposed to supervised release, saying \"he didn't think Ritter was a danger to himself or the alleged victim.\" Ritter's defense attorney Chris Jennings advocated for release without supervision, pointing out \"Ritter's lack of criminal history and unlikelihood of being a flight risk or danger to the community.\" Jennings also noted that \"Ritter also would have been 14 years old at the time of the incident.\" Ritter is a founding member and the CEO of Purple Peake CBD in Denton. Mentioning Ritter's strong ties to the community and employment status, Caroline County Circuit Judge Heather Price ruled to release him on a $10,000 unsecured bond. Ritter is set to appear for a scheduling conference in Caroline County Circuit Court on Feb. 21.",

About two years ago, she states, \u201cI was raped by a man who was staying with another tenant at Bradford House.\u201d Cheaton says the assault occurred inside her own apartment, that she knew the man, and that \u201cHe drugged her before raping her.\u201d After weeks of \u201cthrowing up constantly\u201d and \u201ccrying uncontrollably,\u201d she entered rehab on her therapist\u2019s advice that \u201cshe didn\u2019t have to face her assaulter in the Bradford House halls everyday.\u201d Although she never called police, she later obtained a restraining order, yet \u201cwould still see her rapist in the halls at Bradford House.\u201d\n\nCheaton reports she is \u201cnot the only tenant that has been raped in the building\u201d and describes other dangers: she has \u201cbeen held at knifepoint, threatened and assaulted on the property.\u201d One night, after taking her dog outside, \u201cI had just shut that door,\u201d she remembers. \u201cAnd somebody standing way down there at the end of the building was hollering at me.\u201d The man demanded she leave the door open; when she refused, \u201che got in her face and threatened to shoot her\u201d before disappearing before police arrived. Cambridge Police data show 18 threat-related calls among 1,099 total calls for service to Bradford House from Aug. 1, 2021, to Feb. 21, 2024.\n\nFollowing that incident, Cheaton moved out for a month to live with her daughter. \u201cTo stay sober in a building like this is very, very difficult,\u201d she said. Millennia Housing Management, which runs the complex, stated it \u201csends violations to anyone residing at the property that is the cause of an assault or theft,\u201d and federal Violence Against Women Act provisions allow victims to request emergency transfers or remain in their subsidized homes while perpetrators can be evicted.",

During the plea hearing, Braun said he pleaded guilty because he was guilty and it was in his best interest.\n\nOn June 26, Judge Philip Cronan handed down a five-year sentence with all but one year, five months and 29 days suspended. That nearly 18-month term began June 26. Braun was previously charged on 34 total counts \u2014 17 for promoting and distributing child pornography, and the other 17 for possessing child pornography. As part of the six-count plea agreement, the state did not prosecute the remaining 28 charges.\n\nAt the February plea hearing, prosecutors said the Easton Police Department received a tip last year from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children about a person possessing child sexual abuse material. Investigators identified that person as Braun, prosecutors said. Braun will be registered as a tier II sex offender. He is under five years supervised probation among a number of other conditions.",

    "content": "The Queen Anne's County Sheriff's Office announced two arrests in separate child-abuse investigations. On Sept. 18, deputies arrested Robert Wolfe, 59, of Stevensville, after the Fulton County Sheriff's Office in Hickman, Kentucky, contacted them about a full-extradition warrant for three counts of first-degree sexual abuse of a child younger than 12. Fulton County authorities advised that Wolfe had been entered into the National Crime Information Center (NCIC) database, the sheriff's office said. He was charged as a fugitive from justice and held pending extradition to Kentucky.\n\n\"This case highlights the value of interagency cooperation,\" public information officer Kaitlyn Briselli said in a statement. \"By working closely with our partners in other jurisdictions, we were able to locate and apprehend a fugitive whose actions threatened the safety of our community and, most importantly, our children.\"\n\nIn an unrelated case, Jamie Lee Overton Jr., 23, of Essex, was arrested on Sept. 24 in Baltimore and held without bond. The investigation began Aug. 30 when a county resident alleged an unknown adult male contacted their child, younger than 12, for sexual purposes. After reviewing evidence, investigators obtained a warrant Sept. 19 charging Overton with sexual solicitation of a minor, two counts of child pornography and two counts of obscene telephone misuse.\n\nBecause the investigation is ongoing, the sheriff's office said it could not release specifics on how the child was contacted. Detectives are reviewing evidence to determine whether additional victims may be involved. Anyone with information is asked to contact Detective Cpl. Parker at gparker@qac.org or call the anonymous tip line at 410-758-6666.",

Police had obtained information that Groff was heading to Cambridge from Toddville, about 20 miles south, and located him northwest of Toddville around the Lakesville area. He is being held without bond in the Dorchester County Department of Corrections on two counts each of first- and second-degree rape, third- and fourth-degree sex offense, plus one count each of second-degree assault and false imprisonment.\n\nThe charges stem from an Aug. 13 incident that Cambridge police began investigating on Aug. 16 after contacting a female victim in the hospital. She reported that after pulling into a gas station to inflate a tire, a man engaged her in conversation and they went to a Cambridge residence where, according to the release, \u201cthe male subject was reported to making lewd comments and advancements on the female victim.\u201d The release states, \u201cThe female repeatedly told the male subject \u2018No\u2019 and to \u2018Stop,\u2019\u201d and that \u201cthe male subject ended up reportedly overpowering the female victim and she ended up being raped.\u201d\n\nInvestigators gathered descriptions of the subject, and on Aug. 27 an officer matched them to Groff. Detectives interviewed Groff on Aug. 28, and an arrest warrant was issued Aug. 29. The investigation revealed Groff is a registered sex offender on probation with restrictions. The investigation is ongoing; anyone with information is asked to contact the Cambridge Police Department\u2019s Criminal Investigations Division at 410-901-8457.",

    "content": "EASTON \u2014 An Easton police officer was found guilty on Tuesday of misconduct in office. Sgt. Jason Dyott, 38, was convicted of two separate instances of engaging in physical sexual conduct with two different teenage girls while on duty. Judge C. Carey Deeley Jr. found Easton Police Department Dyott guilty on two counts of misconduct in office.\n\nDuring opening statements of the trial, Senior Assistant State Prosecutor Mary Setzer said that in the fall of 2022, Dyott engaged in physical acts with two teenage girls in separate instances. She said that on Nov. 11, Dyott picked up an 18-year-old from her friend's house in his police vehicle and had sex with her in the vehicle while on duty. Setzer said that two days later, Dyott met with a 17-year-old in the Target parking lot while he was on duty and made out with her.\n\nDyott's defense attorney Shaun Owens said during opening statements that Dyott is not denying the relationships with the teenagers. Owens said the conduct was not criminal, however, and that he does not believe there is evidence to support that Dyott's actions constituted misconduct. Owens said that in any profession, Dyott could have engaged in the exact same behavior. During closing arguments, Owens brought up that the radio call, which the then-18-year-old talked about during testimony. He said that it was not clear what the call was about, if it was for Dyott specifically or if it required Dyott's response.\n\nDeputy State Prosecutor Sarah David said that in the two incidents, Dyott acted in his official capacity. Not only was he on duty, she said, but he was presenting himself to the public and to the teenage girls as an officer. A sentencing hearing is set for Nov. 1. According to a news release from the Office of the State Prosecutor, State Prosecutor Charlton T. Howard III said, \"Law enforcement officers who abuse the power of their position, and betray the trust of the community, must be held accountable.\"\n\nEaston Police Chief Alan Lowrey said Dyott is suspended with pay. He has been suspended with pay since the beginning stages of the investigation in 2023. According to a Wednesday press release, \"upon this conviction, the Easton Police Department will now seek to impose the appropriate administrative penalties upon Mr. Dyott.\"",

    "content": "Lt. Stacey J. Gappert has taken command of the Maryland State Police barrack in Easton, bringing more than 25 years of experience that began when she entered cadet training right after graduating from Queen Anne\u2019s County High School in 1998.  \n\u201cYou start out as a new trooper and then you make TFC (trooper first class). Then you make corporal, then sergeant, the first sergeant and then lieutenant. There are 23 barrack commanders in the state,\u201d she said.  \n\u201cOne day I had an epiphany. I knew I didn\u2019t want to go to college. I really wanted to go to work. I had no law enforcement in my family at all. None. I am still here,\u201d she said.\n\nAfter six years as a lieutenant and commander at the JFK Highway Barrack, Gappert has returned to the Eastern Shore to oversee operations across Dorchester, Talbot and Caroline counties.  \n\u201cMy main responsibilities are oversight of all barrack operations. I now have three assistant commanders. The administrative staff falls under me \u2014 not just troopers, but dispatchers as well. It is a good amount. You need to know your people and what is going to motivate them,\u201d she said.  \nFred Stanco, assistant barrack commander, said, \u201c(Gappert) is the captain of the ship. She is the beginning and the end of the installation. So everything is hers.\u201d\n\nGappert said she values the cooperation among local agencies: \u201cI love working at this barrack because we have three good sheriffs. The municipality chiefs are great. I have only been back a few weeks, but the troopers and the officers get along great. We all work together.\u201d  \n\u201cI think what I am looking for the most would be the relationships with the sheriffs\u2019 departments and the municipalities. We do monthly chief\u2019s meetings. So community relationships and relationships with our allied partners are important,\u201d she said.\n\nRecruiting new troopers is her biggest challenge; the next cadet class is scheduled for late April.  \n\u201cIt has always been a concern not having enough troopers. We are doing the best we can for right now,\u201d she said.  \n\u201cThe climate of getting people to want to be cops and troopers, it is exhausting trying to get people on board to do the job,\u201d she said.  \n\u201cWe do job fairs. We go out of state. We go to schools. The philosophy is to get them when they are young and have them go into the cadet program and then from there get them in the academy,\u201d she said.",

    "content": "Three teenagers are facing attempted carjacking, attempted robbery and other charges after a series of alleged incidents early Monday, Aug. 14, in Cambridge.\n\nAt approximately 6:23 a.m. on Aug. 14, Cambridge Police responded to the 1400 block of the Cambridge Beltway to a report of an attempted carjacking. The victim told officers he was sleeping in his vehicle in the parking lot when he was woken up by an African American male teenager who reached into his vehicle and unlocked the door. Police said the victim reported that several other African American male teenagers opened the car doors and the trunk and started to rummage through the vehicle. The victim then reported that one of the juveniles started to reach into his pockets of his shorts, demanding the victim's wallet and the keys to the vehicle with the threat of a handgun. According to the victim, he began to defend himself and was then jumped and assaulted by the other teenagers, being punched several times and struck multiple times with sticks. A neighbor saw the incident happening and called 911. Police said the suspects then entered a Ford Edge with a Delaware registration and fled the area.\n\nPolice said officers had responded to Walmart earlier that morning to respond to a report of a vehicle that had been gone through. In video footage, police say a small SUV was observed pulling into the parking lot at approximately 5:47 a.m., parking next to a Hyundai passenger car, exiting the SUV and getting in the Hyundai. Footage showed them returning to the SUV later and leaving. At 7:06 a.m., CPD officers responded to the Holiday Inn on the 2700 block of Ocean Gateway to a report of a Kia Sol that had been gone through and the steering column being pulled in an attempt to steal the vehicle. Through further investigation, detectives observed the same Ford Edge pull in the parking lot at approximately 5:33 a.m. Investigators found that the same Ford Edge had returned to Walmart at approximately 7 a.m. Police said three males exited the vehicle and entered the store, allegedly stealing several items before returning to the vehicle and leaving the area. Detectives identified one of the individuals as a 15-year-old from Cambridge. The Laurel Police Department in Delaware told Cambridge police that the Ford Edge was stolen in their jurisdiction.\n\nAt approximately 10:47 a.m., CPD detectives were contacted by the Talbot County Sheriff's Office, who advised the Ford Edge had been located in Trappe. TCSO deputies were standing with the stolen vehicle when another vehicle came to the scene, and one of the deputies saw the 15-year-old juvenile in the back seat. Police placed the 15-year-old under arrest for the stolen vehicle. The 15-year-old was also found to have been reported missing through the Dorchester County Sheriff's Office and had an active warrant for his arrest in Delaware. The 15-year-old was later transferred to the Lower Shore Juvenile Detention Center to await pick up by Delaware law enforcement. CPD detectives identified two additional suspects as a 15-year-old male juvenile and a 17-year-old male juvenile, both from Cambridge. CPD detectives have also referred all three teens to the Department of Juvenile Services on the charges of attempted carjacking, attempted robbery, second-degree assault, theft less than $100, rogue and vagabond, malicious destruction of property, attempted motor vehicle theft and theft of $1,500 to under $25,000. Police said detectives notified the Laurel Police Department of the teens' identities so charges can be filed in Delaware.",

The truck\u2019s driver, 51-year-old Centreville resident David Funk, was seriously injured and died the next day; his 16-year-old son sustained non-life-threatening injuries.\n\nFunk coached with the Delaware Ducks Hockey Club at The Patriot Ice Center in Newark and was involved with the Eastern Shore Hockey Association in Easton and the Queen Anne's County High School hockey team. \"He was a father, husband, friend and coach,\" the Delaware Ducks wrote in a statement. \"This season he coached on our Ducks 10B team and worked with the 18U and Lady Ducks as well. He is a beloved member of our hockey family and will be greatly missed. Please keep his family in your thoughts.\"\n\nTroopers found several containers of alcohol in Villatoro-Martinez's van and smelled alcohol on his breath, police said. After hospital treatment he was charged with first-degree vehicular assault, second-degree vehicular assault, DUI, driving without a license, failure to stop at a red light and additional traffic offenses, and was jailed after failing to post $3,500 secured bond. Police said additional charges are pending now that Funk has died. A GoFundMe page has been established at gofundme.com/f/support-the-funk-family-after-tragedy?qid=5cb41c34e4bcb4cbb075e1484f8fbe89 to help the family pay for Funk's funeral and other expenses.",

    "content": "Kent County commissioners proclaimed April 25 as Child Abuse Prevention and Child Advocacy Appreciation Month during their April 22 meeting in Chestertown. Department of Social Services Director Shelly Neal-Edwards accepted the proclamation alongside her multidisciplinary team and child advocacy center representatives.\n\nCommissioner Albert Nickerson noted that the Child Advocacy Center in Kent County serves more than 35 of the county's \"youngest and most vulnerable citizens\" each year. \"Preventing child abuse is a community-wide responsibility,\" Nickerson said.\n\nNeal-Edwards explained that effective child abuse prevention relies on partnerships among law enforcement, social services and health care officials, supporting Maryland laws that protect child victims' rights and provide essential services in public and private sectors. She thanked the commissioners, emphasizing that everyone plays a vital role in connecting victims with resources for healing and justice.\n\n\"Child Abuse Prevention Month reminds us of the long-term devastating effects but also reminds us of the strength in the community to prevent the abuse,\" Neal-Edwards said. The advocacy center planted blue pinwheels, the symbol of Child Abuse Prevention Month, in the Circuit Court courtyard. Neal-Edwards described them as representing \"the carefree and joyful childhood that every child deserves.\"\n\n\"Let us stand together, advocate for those who have no voice and work toward a brighter future for every child in our community and our county,\" she said.",

The victim was identified as 65-year-old Robert Daywalt.\n\nTyler Davis, 22, of Ridgely, is accused of physically assaulting Daywalt on or around the night of Sept. 28. \"Davis is Daywalt's great-nephew, court records indicate.\" Police say Davis and Daywalt lived together, and \"Davis was a state-certified care provider for his great uncle, per court records.\"\n\nIn a statement of probable cause, police said Davis admitted to them during an interview that he assaulted Daywalt overnight on Sept. 28 or Sept. 29. \"Davis told police he 'had consumed alcohol and did not recall the event' that night, court records state.\" Davis said he made a comment he shouldn't have made to Daywalt, \"at which time (Daywalt) punched\" him. Davis told police he grabbed Daywalt's arms and then assaulted him. \"(Davis) advised during the assault, he was pushed into the dresser, at which time he 'blacked out' and the assault\" continued, police wrote.\n\nDavis was taken into custody without incident and charged with second-degree murder, manslaughter, first- and second-degree assault, reckless endangerment, causing physical injury to a vulnerable adult and other abuse counts. He is being held without bond at the Caroline County Detention Center and is set to appear for a preliminary hearing in Caroline County District Court on Oct. 28.",

    "author": "Natalie Jones; njones@chespub.com",
    "content": "The victim of the shooting near Unionville on Sunday was targeted over a dispute with a common girlfriend, police said Wednesday. Stewart Orlando Ray, 37, of Clinton, was located Tuesday afternoon in northern Virginia in connection to the shooting, which occurred Sunday evening. Deputies from the Talbot County Sheriff's Office responded to the University of Maryland Shore Medical Center at Easton around 9 p.m. Sunday for a shooting victim. The victim, identified as Jahari De'Mon Cooper, 39, of Talbot County was driving near Unionville when Ray passed him and pulled off to the side. As Cooper passed Ray's vehicle, Ray shot at him multiple times, striking both him and his car. Cooper drove himself to the emergency room for treatment, police said.\n\nPolice said Ray fled the area in his vehicle, failed to stop for a stop sign at the intersection of Unionville Road and Bruffs Island Road, left the roadway and struck several parked vehicles, disabling his own car. Ray then fled on foot into the nearby woods, prompting a 24-hour manhunt beginning in the early morning hours Monday. The search for Ray continued despite severe storms hitting the area Monday night into early Tuesday morning. Police said investigators uncovered information early Tuesday morning that Ray may have slipped through the search area during the storms and made his way toward the Washington, D.C., metro area. Around 12:46 p.m. Tuesday, the Alexandria Police Department responded to a shooting in the Potomac Yard Shopping Center, located in the 3600 block of Richmond Highway in the city. After arriving, officers learned that the U.S. Marshals task force had found a wanted fugitive, who was later identified as Ray. Ray was shot when the task force attempted to apprehend him, police said. He was taken to the hospital with life-threatening injuries.\n\nTalbot County Sheriff Joe Gamble expressed his appreciation to the multiple agencies involved in the manhunt. \"I am incredibly grateful to the countless state, local and federal law enforcement officers on the Eastern Shore, CARTIF, and the Alexandria Police Department who willingly put themselves in harm's way to make our community safer during this manhunt,\" Gamble said in a statement. He added: \"During these strange times, as the Maryland Legislature continues to make policing more difficult, it is inspiring to know that there are still selfless men and women who are willing to risk their lives daily for all of us, knowing that their every action will be scrutinized by people who have risked nothing and have never known real danger. I can't thank these public servants enough for their sacrifice and heroism.\"",

Trying to place the voice it took me a few minutes to realize who it was a long-time multigenerational family friend. Let's call him Mike. I would later reflect on what an honor it was for me. For the better part of an hour, he regaled me with stories of yesteryear (none, surprisingly, set in the famed bygone watering hole of that name), featuring my father, grandfather and great-grandfather. My eyes swelled as he began to bring the good old days back to life, first in black and white, then in color. Some stories I had had a taste of, but most were new to me. What gentlemen they were.\n\nThe conversation brought back memories of my great-grandfather Walter Wood; he was the chief of police for then little old Easton. He called it \"my town,\" and used his platform to serve with understanding as only he could. One quality of old Walter I heard about more than a few times was his sensible approach to life. My dad called it his C.S. (common sense) degree. As it goes, he would leave home after supper, head to the firehouse, and open the door to the locals who needed shelter for the night. Today, we call them homeless. He would lock the door and call it a night. In the morning, the routine played out in reverse. What a novel solution.",

The first crash, on Tuesday, July 22, killed a woman whose vehicle was struck while crossing Route 301; the other car\u2019s two occupants, ages 22 and 20, were flown to R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center in critical condition. A second collision at noon on Thursday, July 24, left two more people dead at the scene.\n\nSHA had closed the same crossover for nearly two months in 2024 after 76 crashes were reported there from January 2019 to December 2023. The agency reopened it after reconfiguring the westbound MD 405 approach and trimming roadside trees. With the new closure, SHA is again evaluating long-term fixes. \u201cThere are challenges with at-grade crossings along a major highway, especially as we observe traffic volumes, speed and distracted driving behaviors continue to increase,\u201d Gischlar said, noting that alternate crossings such as MD 19 and Hayden Clark Road \u201care well-marked with flashers to alert drivers to potential cross traffic.\u201d The current closure layout was recommended by the Church Hill Volunteer Fire Department to preserve emergency access. \u201cSHA is committed to improving safety for motorists along this corridor,\u201d Gischlar added. \u201cWe are evaluating larger safety improvements; however, our immediate focus is addressing the safety concerns with near-term projects that improve safety conditions and assist motorists in making good driving decisions.\u201d",

The truck had allegedly \u201cbeen involved in a recent homicide,\u201d though no further details were available.\n\nOfficer A. McGonigle, who patrols the Hollingsworth Manor area, wrote, \u201cI have personally made dozens of arrests in reference to violent crimes and narcotics in this area. Additionally, this area has recently been inundated with violent crime, including a homicide and shooting.\u201d Eight days earlier, on July 18, a 14-year-old was fatally stabbed on Road C in what police called \u201ca pretty strong case of self-defense.\u201d\n\nDuring the traffic stop, McGonigle noted, \u201cI know Santana and Dickerson to be violent offenders through previous incidents with both of them. Additionally, dispatch advised the vehicle had been involved in the recent homicide.\u201d The officer added, \u201cAs I spoke to both Dickerson and Santana, whom I have a rapport with; I noticed they were acting in an unusual manner. Typically, both Dickerson and Santana are very talkative and often joke with me. However, they were unusually quiet and could not maintain eye contact.\u201d A K-9 alerted to the truck, leading to the discovery of an E&J liquor bottle \u201cfilled approximately three-quarters with gasoline\u201d and covered by a gas-soaked blue rag, plus a Bic-style lighter \u201cshoved inside the seat cushion.\u201d\n\nPerkins claimed she filled the bottle at Wawa to fuel a dirt bike on her street, then said the bike wasn\u2019t there; Dickerson and Santana said it was on Mallard Court, but \u201cAll three subjects were traveling from the opposite direction from Mallard Court when stopped.\u201d Santana claimed \u201cthe rag was being used to stop the gasoline from spilling,\u201d while Dickerson admitted he \u201cfilled the bottle with gasoline.\u201d Santana\u2019s pants were soaked, which he attributed to rain, though \u201cthere hadn\u2019t been any precipitation since about 10:45 p.m.\u201d\n\nAll three are charged with possession of a destructive device, a felony carrying up to 25 years and a $250,000 fine.",

    "author": "Carl Hamilton cahamilton@chespub.com",
    "content": "Theresa Ann Moats, 41, was sentenced to six years in prison by Cecil County Circuit Court Judge William W. Davis Jr. on May 12 for the involuntary manslaughter of her 10-year-old daughter, Kyleigh Nicole Treadway, who died in a Christmas Day 2023 townhouse fire at 317 Willow Dr. near Elkton. \"It was totally preventable. I'm not doubting that you love your daughter, but the care wasn't there,\" Davis told Moats, adding, \"This is the exact definition of a difficult case. You have the tragic loss of a young person and there his zero intention for this to happen. It's the nature of the charge.\"\n\nInvestigators found the home filled with as many as 35 pets, animal waste, trash and overloaded extension cords powering heavy appliances, with no working smoke detectors; Kyleigh, asleep in a second-floor bedroom, was trapped while the rest of the family escaped. School records showed chronic neglect: Kyleigh arrived at Cecil Manor Elementary reeking of waste, prompting the nurse to wash her clothes and hair, and referrals were made to Cecil County Department of Social Services. \"It was the saddest fact pattern I've ever read,\" Davis said. \"Her existence seemed to be miserable and her demise was miserable. It does make me want to cry.\"\n\nMoats, who received credit for 424 days already served, tearfully told the court, \"Living without my daughter has been like a mental prison. I miss her. I can't hug her. I can't play games with her. Life is dull. She was the shining star of the family. Kyleigh was everything to me . . . I can't look at her picture. I wish she was here.\" Assistant State's Attorney Gavin Patashnick, who sought the maximum 10-year term, argued, \"The defendant flatly refuses to accept any responsibility . . . The house was in shambles . . . Kyleigh didn't have any friends. No one would touch her. Her only friends were teachers. This child was essentially forgotten,\" and detailed that Kyleigh \"died horribly,\" with burns over 90 percent of her body and \"soot in her mouth, smoke in her lungs.\" Defense attorney Emily Gillis blamed Social Services for failing to intervene after 18 animals were removed five days earlier, asserting, \"There was no shelter plan, no safety plan . . . The Department of Social Services failed. They (social services) would have had Kyleigh with them if they had done their job properly.\"",

Sen. Antonio Hayes (D-Baltimore City) said he first learned of the threat from \u201ca member of the press\u201d while voting in a Finance Committee meeting; only afterward did a state trooper order the room to shelter in place. \u201cI wish I would have gotten a text message internally before I got one externally, but I think just given the series of events, it is what it is,\u201d Hayes said.\n\nThe anonymous call came in around 5 p.m. to Annapolis City Police; Maryland Capitol Police ultimately found no evidence of danger. On Friday both chambers gave officers a standing ovation. \u201cYesterday was certainly a very scary moment for many, a very intense moment, but a moment when our first responders did everything that they were supposed to do and kept everyone safe, followed protocol and really responded to a very intense situation appropriately,\u201d Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore County) told reporters.\n\nA Department of General Services spokesperson offered no comment on the communication efforts.

Will Folden (R-Frederick), an active-duty Frederick city officer, defended the limited information flow: \u201cThe one thing you can\u2019t have happen is, you don\u2019t want to over alert or over alarm the people you\u2019re trying to protect. It\u2019s a necessary element to only provide absolutely necessary information to not create panic.\u201d\n\nThe incident came days after the General Assembly signed a Motorola contract for a text-alert system for State House officials; the network is still under construction and was not operational Thursday. \u201cWithin the structure we have right now, (state troopers) did an amazing job. I think we all would like a world in which we had a text service to keep us informed,\u201d said Sen. Sarah Elfreth (D-Anne Arundel). Hayes added, \u201cI didn\u2019t even realize that we were in the middle of negotiating a text messaging contract, which I think would have been helpful.\u201d Lawmakers said they remain grateful for police efforts while awaiting the new alert platform.",

    "content": "Transcript reveals final words from Dali crew before Key Bridge collapse\n\n June 3, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: LIV BARRY obarry@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 887\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Just five minutes prior to the collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge on March 26, 2024, crewmen aboard the Dali ship were conducting business as usual.At 1:06 a.m., the ship's pilot communicated to one of the Dali's tugboats: \"I like my chances if you want to take off.\"\n\"Alright \u2014 all done here. (Have) safe trip,\" the tugboat Bridget McAllister responded.\nLess than 20 minutes later, around 1:25 a.m., the Dali's command center was sent into chaos as the vessel lost power.\nA transcript released by the National Transportation Safety Board in April, which was first reported by The Baltimore Banner on Monday, notes the first 25 minutes of the Dali's voyage as unremarkable.\nHowever, the initial power outage, signified in the transcript by a sound \"similar to Automatic Power Change Over Circuit\" and multiple blaring alarms that continued throughout the collision, threw the crew into a state of alarm.\nWhat followed the power outage is a series of internal and external communications between Dali crew members, the Dali's tugboats, the Maryland Transportation Authority Command Center. To better lay out the events leading to the collision, The Dundalk Eagle has organized the communications between calls for external help, attempts to lower the anchor and attempts to use bow thrusters.\nCALLS FOR HELP\nImmediately upon losing power, the pilot asked the second officer and helmsman if they had steering, to which both responded yes.\nAs the crew attempted to maneuver the ship away from the Key Bridge, the pilot communicated to the second officer and helmsman again at 1:25:24 p.m.\n\"(Just) let me know if you can't steer,\" the pilot said.\nSeconds after the pilot's command, another sound similar to an automatic power change is noted in the transcript. The pilot then communicated with the AMP Pilot Command Center.\n\"@[AMP Pilot Dispatcher] have them shut down the Bay Bridge. I just lost steering \u2014 not the Bay Bridge \u2014 the, uh ... Key Bridge,\" the pilot said.\nAt 1:26:10 a.m., the helmsman reported that they were \"swinging to starboard.\" Soon after, the pilot can be heard asking for a \"mac boat,\" referring to the Dali's two tugboats, the Bridget McAllister and Eric McAllister.\n\"Calling the Mac boats \u2014 anybody out there?\" the pilot asked at 1:26:38 a.m. Just seven seconds later, the Eric McAllister responded.\n\"Hey Eric [IMO 9707413] it's the Dali \u2014 I need ya over here quick. I've uh just lost power (heading to the Key Bridge),\" the pilot said.\nSimultaneously, as the pilot called the Eric McAllister, the pilot's command center contacted the MDTA.\n\"No there's a vessel \u2014 I'm calling for the pilot. There's a ship heading toward the Key Bridge. He lost steering. We need to stop all traffic on the Key Bridge,\" the pilot's command center said to the MDTA Command Center at 1:26:57 a.m.\nAs the captain attempted to lower the anchors, the training pilot made a call over very high frequency (VHF) radio to alert other ships at 1:27:25 a.m.\n\"Security call. Security call. Container ship Dali has lost power. Approaching the Key Bridge \u2014 I repeat \u2014 the container ship Dali has lost all power approaching the Key Bridge \u2014 Dali,\" the training pilot said.\nThis was the final external warning call.\nATTEMPTS TO LOWER ANCHOR\nAfter the pilot's command center asked to close traffic on the bridge, the captain can be heard asking the forward crewman to let go of the port anchor.\n\"Sir I cannot * * *,\" the forward said. According to the NTSB, the rest of the forward's response could not be made out over shouting on the ship's bridge, marking the obscuring with asterisks.\nThe captain again called for the anchor to be lowered at 1:27:14 a.m., shouting, \"Fast, fast let go port anchor.\"\nAs the pilot attempted to use the bow thrusters, the captain continued to command the forward to lower the anchor, imploring the crewman until he received another response at 1:27:55 a.m.\n\"I tried to open the break. Break is not able to open up,\" the forward said.\nAt 1:28:42, the frontman told the captain that he opened the break.\n\"Let go. Let go,\" the captain said in response.\nAfter not receiving a response, the captain checked back in with the forward at 1:29 a.m. exactly before delivering what would be the final words before the crash is marked on the transcript: \"Let go, yes.\"\nLAST-RESORT ATTEMPTS\nThe pilot made one final attempt to prevent the ship from colliding with the Key Bridge.\nAt 1:27:42, the pilot asked the crew if the ship had bow thrusters. According to The Baltimore Banner, the device helps guide ships laterally while docking.\nAfter the crew confirmed to the pilot that the ship had bow thrusters, the second officer delivered devastating news: \"No. It's not working.\"\n\"Not working #,\" the pilot said, with an expletive marked by a pound sign in the transcript. These would be the pilot's final words before the collision, which is estimated by the transcript to have occurred at 1:29:06 a.m.\nWhat followed was a story that Dundalk knows well: six construction workers dead and a span that connected Baltimore left twisted in spirals of steel.\nAs the collision is still under investigation, around 12 Dali crewmen remain in Baltimore. This June marks a year since the crew was allowed to leave the ship, as cleanup efforts, expired visas and maritime law complicated their departure.\nTo read the full transcript, including the events before and after the Dali lost power, visit the docket at ntsb.gov/investigations/Pages/DCA24MM031.aspx \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "CHESTER \u2014 On Monday, Sheriff Gary Hofmann and Queen Anne\u2019s County Chamber of Commerce President Linda Friday began distributing free ONEbox opioid-overdose-reversal kits to 11 local businesses. Hofmann called the kits \u201can emergency opioid overdose reversal kit designed to promote safety by assuring that individuals have life-saving, on-demand training when and where they need it,\u201d adding, \u201c(AEDs) save lives, and these kits will too.\u201d\n\nEach ONEbox contains two Narcan doses, personal-protection equipment for responders, and an English-and-Spanish self-playing instruction video. Hofmann noted overdoses can strike anyone, not just people with addiction: \u201cOpioid overdoses are not just contained to those with an addiction \u2026 but can happen to anyone who may not realize they are taking more prescription pain medicine than is safe.\u201d\n\nSince January 2023 the county has provided 1,488 free Narcan doses with training; schools stock the spray for nurses, and peer specialists meet overdose patients at the hospital. Chamber program coordinator Rebecca Groff said, \u201cThe goal is to distribute these kits to businesses throughout the county, regardless of their size,\u201d while Friday observed, \u201cQAC businesses give all the time to worthwhile community causes,\u201d aiming \u201cto give something back to them that could be life saving.\u201d\n\nThe Chamber, County Commissioners, Drug Free Coalition, Health Department and Sheriff\u2019s Office are jointly funding the effort; Health Department Prevention Specialist Anna Ashley coordinates distribution. Hofmann is urging businesses to request boxes while supplies last, and Chamber executive director Wright concluded, \u201cThis is a great example of the community coming together \u2014 everyone working together makes tasks easier.\u201d Businesses can contact Becky Groff at 410-643-8530 or rgroff@qacchamber.com.",

Darling, who arrived at the scene with Kent EMS Paramedic 11.\nFirst responders initially used garden hoses from the property and a neighboring home to combat the flames before additional units arrived. A second alarm was called due to staffing needs and the size of the house, bringing in additional resources including a tanker task force, though some were later deemed unnecessary, according to fire officials.\nFire crews deployed two hand lines upon arrival, with one targeting the roof fire and another addressing flames in the attic. The fire was contained to the second-floor attic and the section of roof containing the solar panels, the fire department said.\nThe Maryland State Fire Marshal's Office determined the cause was related to the solar panels. Tesla, the apparent manufacturer of the system, was notified, and representatives met with homeowners at the scene.\nNo injuries to civilians or firefighters were reported.\nEight volunteer fire companies and emergency services from Kent and Queen Anne's counties responded to the incident.\nOfficials from the fire department advised, \"As more homes install solar panels, it's important for homeowners to understand the potential fire risks and how to reduce them. While solar panels are generally safe and highly regulated, like any electrical system, they can pose hazards if improperly installed, damaged or affected by environmental factors.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Several items were seized from Labastida's home, including a loaded 9mm handgun, police said.Labastida is charged with conspiracy to escape, numerous counts of first-and second-degree assault, reckless endangerment, firearm charges and malicious destruction of property over $1,000.Charges are still pending in Rockville for items seized from Labastida's residence, police said.The charges against Labastida stem from his alleged involvement with the patient's escape from the psychiatric facility.Officers from the Cambridge Police Department responded to the facility in the 5200 block of Woods Road just after 5:30 p.m. Aug. 1 for a shooting incident.Security officers on scene at the hospital told police that an unknown person in a black vehicle approached the building and shot several times into a glass window. The unknown person then kicked the broken window out, which allowed a hospital patient to escape with the unknown person in the black vehicle, police said.Police said no injuries were reported at the scene.Detectives from CPD's criminal investigation also responded to the scene and recovered several spent shell casings, police said.The patient who escaped was identified as Darrin Lee Jeter, 19, of Rockville.Police said Jeter had been committed to the hospital center for assault on law enforcement officers in Montgomery County.Detectives continued the investigation through contacting law enforcement in Montgomery County, where Jeter was later located.Jeter was charged with first-degree escape and is being held without bond. His case remains pending in Dorchester County Circuit Court.Labastida was ordered held without bond during an initial appearance Tuesday. A bail review is set for Wednesday in Glen Burnie District Court in Anne Arundel County. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "YMCA fire on Saturday intentionally set, fire marshal says\n\n January 13, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 457\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON \u2014 A fire at the YMCA on Peachblossom Road on Saturday was intentionally set, according to the Office of the State Fire Marshal.At around 12:30 p.m., Easton firefighters responded to a fire on the second floor, which took just under an hour to control, per the fire marshal. No injuries were reported.\nA preliminary investigation ruled the cause as \"incendiary.\" The fire marshal stated that \"subject(s) ignited a small pile of party supplies located on the second floor rear storage hallway.\"\nNormal operations at the Y resumed Sunday.\nYMCA of the Chesapeake CEO Robbie Gill said, \"it's disheartening to know that that can happen.\"\n\"The Y's been in this community 168 years,\" Gill said Monday. \"It serves one in three people. It's kind of a third place where people go. It's a place where everyone is welcome.\"\nThe blaze around 12:30 p.m. was the first of two fires at the Y on Saturday. Around 5:30 p.m., firefighters were once again called to the Y, where an HVAC unit was on fire on the building's roof.\nThe cause of the HVAC fire was deemed to be a mechanical failure. The fire marshal ruled that second blaze as accidental and said it was unrelated to the incident earlier that day.\nBoth fires caused a combined $50,000 in estimated damages, according to the fire marshal's reports.\nGill said he's grateful the Easton Volunteer Fire Department responded so promptly and that there weren't extensive damages to the Y. Saturday's first fire was extinguished by the Y's sprinkler system before firefighters arrived at the scene.\nPeter Hyman, president of the YMCA's board, was on his way to the Y around noon on Saturday when he learned of the first fire. He noticed community members and Y staff gathering.\n\"The staff was upset. It was an upsetting moment, and I just did what I could to help both in terms of the emotions of the folks as well as the physical reality of the situation,\" Hyman said Sunday morning.\n\"When something like this happens, it's offensive on a multiplicity of levels,\" Hyman added.\nGill said the Y is going to take a look at its procedures and protocols moving forward, as well as continuing to work with law enforcement in its investigation.\nThe fire marshal's office is asking anyone with information regarding the intentionally set fire to contact its Upper Eastern Regional Office at 410-819-3500.\nGill said the fact that someone tried to \"impact the sanctity\" of the Y as a community center is \"always scary at the time and also sad.\"\n\"But if there's one thing about Talbot County and our community, it is a tight group of people,\" Gill said. \"... Something like this isn't going to deter us from continuing to make a positive impact.\"\nStar Democrat editor Wendy Weitzel contributed to this report. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Zoar Road while the son was attempting to break into his parents' home, police reported at the time.\nDuring the incident leading up to the fatal shooting, the patriarch's 78-year-old wife suffered injuries, police said. An ambulance crew drove the woman to Upper Chesapeake Medical Center in Bel Air, where she was treated for unspecified injuries that were not caused by gunfire, police added.\n\"Following a thorough review of the evidence, Maryland State Police investigators determined that the decedent was shot while attempting to break into the home after an earlier physical and verbal altercation with the resident elderly couple. After a review of the current statute, case law, and all information gathered by the Maryland State Police, the Office of the State's Attorney has elected to not proceed with criminal charges. In these circumstances, the suspect was protecting himself and his wife and was acting in self-defense,\" an SAO spokeswoman explained.\nThe father was cooperative throughout the investigation, police reported.\nMSP troopers assigned to the agency's North East Barrack rushed to scene shortly before 2 p.m. on Sept. 24 in response to a reported shooting, police said.\nFirefighters responded to that Mt. Zoar Road property, too, and extinguished a blaze at an adjacent home, police added.\nAfter completing their concurrent investigation, detectives with the Maryland Office of the State Fire Marshal ruled \"undetermined\" for the cause of that blaze, the SAO spokeswoman reported. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

After the man declined, Gibbs allegedly started yelling aggressively as she accused the alleged victim of \"being smart with\" her and then ordered Hand, who was standing nearby, to kill him, police added.\nAt that point, Hand allegedly started beating the man with a \"metal blunt object,\" prompting the alleged victim to hold up a mattress to deflect the blows, according to the charging document.\nThen Gibbs and Hand cut open the man's tent with their knives, court records allege.\nThe man told investigators that Gibbs yelled, \"Stop,\" to Hand and, at that point, the suspects got into white 2019 Dodge Ram and sped away, police reported.\nAfter the suspects had fled, the man realized that his bicycle and $150 were missing, police said, noting that his bike is valued at $150. During the incident, the man's tent and mattress were destroyed, translating to a $500 loss, police added.\nCourt records indicate that the man told investigators that he was \"longtime friends\" with Gibbs, whom he described to police as \"an older white female of medium build with no teeth.\" He, however, did not know her last name \u2014 only that it started with a \"G,\" police noted.\nThe alleged victim described Hand as a \"middle aged\" white man of \"skinny build with face tattoos,\" police reported.\n\"Due to the suspect descriptions, officers believed the suspect description provided matched those of Brandy Gibbs and Justin Hand, who(m) officers are familiar with through prior contact,\" according to the charging document.\nWhen an investigator displayed photos of Hand and Gibbs, the alleged victim identified them as the suspects, court records show. Investigators were able to track down Hand and Gibbs and arrest them, police reported.\nHand and Gibbs are each facing numerous criminal charges, including home invasion, first-degree assault, robbery, theft, malicious destruction of property and related conspiracy counts, court records show. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Lawmakers work toward juvenile justice solution\n\n March 5, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: STEPH QUINN Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 994\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ANNAPOLIS \u2014 Lawmakers are moving toward consensus on changes to Maryland's juvenile justice system, discussing how to address crime by children ages 10 to 12 and get them into rehabilitation programs that can help.The House and Senate have each passed their own version in this effort, and lawmakers are now turning to the task of agreeing on a shared solution.\nThe main point of contention between the two bills now is whether kids who are being shielded from prosecution should go to programs without Department of Juvenile Services involvement or, instead, go into a Juvenile Services process that would play out in court.\n\"I think that what it comes down to is both sides want to find some way prior to the child being put directly into DJS, of having a stop on the way before that happens,\" said Del. Luke Clippinger (D-Baltimore City), co-sponsor of the House bill.\nSen. Will Smith (D-Montgomery), co-sponsor in the Senate, said that in discussions to agree on a single bill, lawmakers will \"do whatever makes sense to ensure that, obviously, our youth have the supports to succeed and public safety is upheld.\"\nBut as the measures advance, they also differ on the crimes that would trigger mandatory rehabilitation.\nThe House bill would give kids accused of auto theft or firearms violations for the first time a chance to avoid court by participating in a so-called \"diversion program\" chosen by the arresting officer. Such a program is meant to offer services and divert a child from entering the juvenile justice system.\nThe Senate bill would send kids accused of auto theft for the first time to court through an existing DJS procedure, known as the \"Child in Need of Supervision\" process.\nIn current law, when law enforcement or a member of the public reports someone as a Child in Need of Supervision, a DJS intake officer can decide whether to refer the young person to services or file a \"CINS petition\" in court. A CINS petition asks the judge to assess the case and decide on an appropriate intervention.\nThe amended Senate bill would require the filing of a petition in court, but only in cases of children under 13 accused of auto theft for the first time.\nWhile a judge could choose from a range of options in such cases \u2014 such as community-based services, a substance abuse rehabilitation program or an out-of-home placement \u2014 incarceration would not be on the table. And if a child did not complete the rehabilitation, the judge could recall them to court.\nLawmakers are also working to address lapses of communication between police and DJS with their bills.\nBoth bills would require police to file a written report with DJS when they refer a young person to services or take them into custody. The CINS petition required in the Senate bill would also create a written record that would go into a child's case history.\nSmith said that by requiring an intake officer to send children before a judge, the Senate bill will allow children \"to have the ability to get services and support, but there will be a level of accountability there.\"\nBoth bills would specify that if a child repeats the same offense a second time, they could be sent to court with the possibility of incarceration.\nClippinger said he's \"happy to hear more from the Senate\" but that creating a separate CINS process for children ages 10 to 12 accused of auto theft could create confusion.\n\"The special kind of CINS, at least how it is described to me, sounds an awful lot like just putting kids at the Department of Juvenile Services,\" Clippinger said. CINS \"has been administered disparately\" by DJS, he added.\nEven with these changes, the amended bills have failed to win the approval of some youth advocates and public defenders.\n\"Only one diversion for a kid who's 10, 11 or 12 is not going to solve the problem of whether they're competent to stand trial,\" said Kimber Watts, attorney in the Forensic Mental Health Division at the Maryland Office of the Public Defender.\nWhen a young person is charged with a crime, they undergo a process to determine whether they are \"competent\" to understand the court proceedings. During this process, they can only receive services to help them attain competency.\nIn cases when children are ruled incompetent, Watts said, \"then we're high and dry, and we can't get them whatever it is they need.\"\nBoth versions of the bill moved through their chambers with largely favorable votes, with support from Democrats and Republicans.\nSen. William Folden (R-Frederick) said that while the Senate bill wasn't \"as far-reaching as we would like to have had,\" it would help hold kids accountable for their rehabilitation.\n\"That's an important component, being able to have that recall authority of the judge to say that their sentencing and their guidelines have some teeth,\" Folden said.\nNeither bill would change a 2022 law that bars police from interrogating minors before they have consulted with an attorney.\n\"There are parents that want law enforcement to be in contact with their child and say, 'Listen, you're going down a bad path. Don't do this. This is why,'\" said Folden. \"That type of candid dialogue is now gone because the officer can't talk (with the young person) even with parental consent.\"\nThe House and Senate both amended their bills to move up the work of the proposed Commission on Juvenile Justice Reform and Emerging Best Practices from October to July. The House bill would push back the implementation date of its other measures to January to give some jurisdictions time to stand up diversion programs, while the rest of the Senate bill would go into effect Oct. 1.\nDel. Cheryl Pasteur (D-Baltimore County) said she decided to vote for the bill because the House had \"ameliorated\" penalties for 10- to 12-year-olds. She urged her colleagues to use the commission to prioritize prevention of youth crime.\n\"We have commissions, and sometimes the seats don't get filled. We don't take them seriously,\" Pasteur said. \"This time, we need to take it seriously.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Kent County weighs ICE cooperation amid liability concerns\n\n March 28, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: WILL BONTRAGER wbontrager@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 626\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CHESTERTOWN \u2014 Will Kent County police cooperate with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement when and if they call? More specifically, will they participate in the 287(g) program, which allows local law enforcement agencies to collaborate with ICE to detain immigrants?Kent County Sheriff Dennis Hickman acknowledges this is a complicated issue, based on recommendations from the Maryland State's Attorney's Office.\nA 2018 guidance memorandum states that law enforcement agencies can cooperate, but are not required to do so and could be liable in certain situations.\n\"As the elected sheriff, I don't want to potentially cause additional liability to me or our county government, but we don't want the same problems that we have seen in other counties,\" Hickman said in an interview with the Kent County News.\nHickman is referring to the releasing of dangerous criminals back into the community. By refusing to cooperate with ICE, local lawmakers could release a person charged with a minor offense while the federal government has information about a more serious crime.\nAlthough Hickman is aware of liability issues, his first priority is protecting the public.\nThe issue is politically charged across Maryland and the country. Democratic lawmakers are advocating for eliminating the federal program altogether. On March 17, during the Maryland General Assembly crossover session, Delegate Nicole Williams, D-Prince George's County, advanced a bill that appeared closer to passage.\n\"We should not be doing the federal government's job for them,\" Williams told her colleagues during a floor debate.\nIn the state Senate, Sen. Will Smith, D-Montgomery County, has proposed a \"protected spaces\" bill that would require guidelines for how ICE carries out actions in sensitive locations like churches and schools.\nSeveral Maryland jurisdictions already have policies limiting cooperation with ICE.\nHoward County's Liberty Act prohibits county employees from asking residents about their immigration status and bans discrimination based on citizenship status.\nSimilarly, in Prince George's County, legislation has been enacted to ban local agencies from cooperating with immigration enforcement.\nDespite opposition, sheriffs from Garrett, Allegany and Washington counties agreed to assist ICE, joining Frederick County, which has been assisting for several years.\nHickman acknowledged that this level of cooperation is not feasible in Kent County, not because they oppose the policy, but because it requires additional training and duties without federal compensation.\nMost likely, Kent will not enter into a 287(g) agreement but will cooperate while trying to avoid liability and maintain public safety.\nOn its website, ICE expressed gratitude for the three counties' cooperation in the Secure Communities Program, which helps \"identify criminal aliens in state prisons and local jails by running their fingerprints against federal immigration databases when they are locked in the system.\"\nThis information-sharing program now includes 21 counties, including Kent.\nMatt Elliston, Maryland ICE director, warned that cooperating with the state may put local law enforcement in liability issues, but not cooperating could also create consequences.\nIn Frederick and Howard counties, Elliston is calling on the U.S. Department of Justice to take action against them for refusing ICE detainers and releasing criminals without notifying ICE.\nFor Hickman, a balanced approach is best and, most importantly, safest. \"Some counties refuse to cooperate with the federal government, resulting in releasing potentially dangerous people back into the community,\" he said. \"Failing to have some measure of cooperation is not in the best interest of our community.\"\nCurrently, the county has not been asked to assist ICE beyond notifying the agency before a state release. The Kent County Sheriff's Department has not been asked to hold anyone past their state-release date.\n\"If ICE has a detainer on someone, we will let them know when they are done with local charges and they are welcome to meet them at the back gate to pick them up,\" Hickman clarified.\nSince the mid-March, there have been no ICE seizures, but one individual completed their local sentence and was then received by ICE. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "'It was all smiles': Cambridge National Night Out brings more than 800 to county pool\n\n August 14, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MAGGIE TROVATO mtrovato@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 582\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE \u2014 This year's National Night Out event in Cambridge brought more people, more hotdogs and more smiles.\"Like many other years, it was another successful year,\" Cambridge Police Chief Justin Todd said. \"We had tons of kids and a lot of people and businesses and community leaders that came out and all took part. It was all smiles.\"\nBetween 800 and 900 people showed up to the Dorchester County Pool on Aug. 6 for National Night Out on, compared to around 600 people last year, Cambridge Police Captain Antoine Patton said.\nPatton said all of the feedback he received about the evening was positive. He said multiple children came up to him to thank him and tell him they had a great time.\nTodd said all of the positive feedback is why the police department continues to hold the event at the pool year after year.\n\"I think there's just something about being at the county pool and the kids being able to have the opportunity to swim for a couple hours, not worry about any prices or charges and just enjoy time with their friends and family,\" he said.\nAttendees were able to talk with a variety of vendors, from the Dorchester County Health Department to the Department of Juvenile Services to the Boys and Girls Club. The different vendors offered pamphlets and information about the resources they have available to residents.\nSimilar to the number of attendees, Patton said there were more vendors at this year's event than in years past. Todd said that number has increased every year.\n\"And it's good because you get those necessary resources and information that people may not otherwise see or get,\" Todd said. \"It actually gets handed to them. And they can talk to one another and start forming those bonds.\"\nAlong with swimming in the pool, listening to the music played by DJ Doc Lane and eating hotdogs courtesy of the police department, a handful of lucky attendees won prizes that had been donated by Paul Davis Restoration. Prizes ranged from a TV, to a Minnie Mouse kitchen set, to a gas grill, to baskets filled with household goods.\n\"The lady who won a TV actually cried,\" Patton said.\nNot only did attendees get served the 700 hotdogs the police station cooked up, but MidShore Meals til Monday \u2014 a nonprofit that provides food for food-insecure children and families in Dorchester County \u2014 handed out bags of food, Patton said.\nTodd said National Night Out represents what Cambridge police have been trying to do for the last two years: community-oriented policing.\n\"It's building relationships between the police and the community,\" he said. \"But also (building) other relationships such as (with) Juvenile Services, the health department, the Dorchester County school system. ... Us all working together to build a stronger community for tomorrow.\"\nAccording to National Night Out's website, the event was first held in 1984. It aims to promote partnerships between the police and community nationwide, as well as make neighborhoods safer. Patton said the event was created with the intention of having a night without crime in every community.\n\"And what it does is it brings community together and it gives them a live interaction with law enforcement officers to let the community know that we're working together and we support them just like they support us,\" he said about the event.\nPatton thanked Dorchester County Recreation and Parks for allowing Cambridge police to hold the event at the county pool.\n\"It was a great event and we look forward to doing it again,\" he said. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Democratic lawmakers plan to crack down on youth crime in the coming weeks\n\n February 1, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: STEPH QUINN Capital News Service | Section: General Assembly \n \n 587\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ANNAPOLIS \u2014 Children as young as 10 could potentially go to court for auto thefts and handgun violations, under one proposal key Democratic lawmakers detailed on Wednesday and plan to push for in the legislature in coming weeks.The lawmakers propose giving Juvenile Services officers the option to route a young person's case to court if the child is 10 to 13 years of age and accused of these or other crimes \u2014 adding them to the list of serious offenses that already can land a young person before a judge.\nThe proposals are meant to promote collaboration and make the system work more smoothly, Democratic officials said, but youth advocates worry that they will lead to higher incarceration rates, especially of youth of color.\n\"Right now, juvenile offenders and the services and accountability they need are separated by an abundance of confusion,\" said House Speaker Adrienne Jones, D-Baltimore County. \"Egos, political agendas and arguments over process have filled the gaps.\"\nThere must be \"accountability for adults in the system, who are charged with administering the system,\" said Senate President Bill Ferguson, D-Baltimore City. \"We must ensure that all parts are working to their highest potential.\"\nJones and Ferguson joined Democratic Gov. Wes Moore on Wednesday for a public announcement of the proposals, alongside the lawmakers who crafted them.\nThe raft of changes, if enacted, would toughen a reform law the state legislature passed in 2022. Among other things, that reform barred police from charging young people under 13 except when they are accused of the most serious crimes.\nThe newly unveiled legislative package would expand that list of serious crimes and lengthen the maximum probation period that can be ordered by a judge. It would also expand the reporting responsibilities of a state agency charged with oversight of the youth justice system.\nThe announcement on Wednesday gave shape to Democrats' response to pleas for accountability amid spikes in certain youth offenses in recent years. While youth violent crime arrests fell 16.5% overall between fiscal years 2020 and 2023, according to a Juvenile Services report last year, carjackings increased by 85.4% and handgun violations rose almost 220%.\nAfter weeks of talks with law enforcement and advocates, the set of proposals represents a general agreement among Democrats, who control both chambers of the legislature and also hold the governor's office.\nBut advocates in the Maryland Youth Justice Coalition predicted in a written statement that the \"legislation introduced today will see thousands more kids incarcerated every year, particularly Black and brown children, and (exacerbate) the already serious racial disparities in Maryland's juvenile justice system.\"\nAs the minority party, Republicans have said in recent months that the reform law leaves Marylanders less safe and also prevents young people from getting the services they need. GOP lawmakers in Annapolis have their own ideas for change, including a measure that would prohibit young people who have committed sexual offenses from attending school in person.\nBut one key Republican on Wednesday said the Democrats' plan shows they are taking \"first steps\" in addressing flaws in the youth justice system. House Minority Leader Jason Buckel, R-Allegany, said he appreciates that Moore has put his weight behind the issue of youth crime.\n\"For him to be able to step in and say, 'Hey, I'm a Democrat. I'm from Baltimore City, but I'm going to step up and say too much is too much and this is a reasonable way to deal with this' \u2014 it's incredibly helpful,\" Buckel said.\nBuckel said he also hopes Moore will be able to persuade fellow Democrats to consider other tough ideas, too. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Ketterman previously ordered Lopez to not have contact with any victims and to not enter or be found near several specific locations in St.Michaels.Lopez received about six months of credit for time already served in connection to the April charges. Following his release from jail, he will be placed on three years of supervised probation.Lopez will also be required to submit to a mental health evaluation and complete mental health and alcohol treatment. \n \n Caption: DIEGO ALBARADO LOPEZ \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Lt. Richard Mellinger, commander of the Easton Composite Squadron, Civil Air Patrol, led a group of young cadets and senior members in arranging the flags, which are easily spotted by drivers on U.S. Route 50. Mellinger said recognizing fallen heroes with the patriotic display is extremely meaningful.\nThe flag display is part of the Rotary Club's Flags for Heroes initiative, which honors veterans, law enforcement officers, first responders, teachers, health care workers and more. It was started in 2012, and every May since, flags have been erected throughout Easton.\nThis year, in addition to the community center, flags were placed at Idlewild Park, Aqua Pools & Spas and Londonderry on the Tred Avon.\nRotary Club Secretary George Hatcher said the tradition \"has never failed to be something that brings people together.\"\nThe Easton Rotary Club has raised nearly $600,000 since 2012 through donations from those who sponsor a flag for their heroes. The proceeds go to local organizations such as the Talbot County Sheriff's Office, Easton Police Department, Civil Air Patrol, local fire departments and more. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

According to the document, in the video Perry is seen picking up the crying toddler and walking him over to a changing table. When Perry puts the boy on the changing table, he cries even louder, the document says.\nIn the video, Perry can be heard telling the boy, \"You better not kick me, young man,\" and \"Stop,\" as she changes his diaper. According to the document, Perry then lifts both of the toddler's legs and audibly smacks him on the butt, causing other teachers in the room to take notice.\nAt this point, the toddler is \"crying and screaming,\" the document says.\nPerry then takes the boy's left arm, lifting him up off the table. She grabs his other arm and \"quickly\" puts him on the floor, letting him fall onto his back, the document says. She leaves him on the ground crying and tells another teacher in the room that is what the boy does, according to the document.\nIn an interview, the parents of the child told Hanson the child might have autism, and they were meeting with doctors to make that determination, the document says.\nTwo teachers in the room at the time of the incident provided witness statements. One of those witnesses described Perry as \"overly aggressive\" with the two year old, the document says. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

In Peoria County, for example, text scammers also meant to deceive voters into registering to vote by mail through a false link.\nEnsuring the integrity of elections and maintaining public trust are critical issues for Maryland election officials and the nation, especially as the 2024 election nears and texting scams become more prevalent.\nAs the state elections administrator, DeMarinis is tasked with administering and conducting elections and creating consistent policy and application of the laws in Maryland.\nThe Maryland board was already working to recruit election judges, track mail-in ballots and secure the local elections. Now, they must also battle continuous threats to undermine public trust in elections.\nAccording to the board, the text scam informs recipients that public records show they are not registered at their address. The matter is \"URGENT,\" the text says. The text then invites the recipient to click a fake link to register before the deadline.\nThe board's website lists the valid sources for voter registration, polling locations, mail-in ballot status and ways to vote. The board is also reminding voters that trusted information will come from a .gov web address.\nDeMarinis told CNS he is determined to combat the spread of disinformation by being proactive on social media. He also encouraged people to contact him or the state board to verify information.\n\"You don't wait until things hit critical mass,\" he said, \"you combat this information and correct the record immediately.\"\nThe board created a portal on its website where people can report instances of scamming and disinformation. DeMarinis said he plans to work with social media platforms to help correct false information.\nHe said that if scam efforts rise to the level of voter disenfranchisement or suppression, the board will work with law enforcement to ensure that Marylanders are \"free to vote, without any sort of undue influence.\"\nAs the general election approaches with only 48 days left and early voting starting on Sept. 23, the threat of these scammers remains high. The public must remain vigilant and in the meantime, the board will continue its efforts to combat scams and safeguard the integrity of the election, he said.\n\"These scams are a direct threat to the legitimacy of the electoral process, because, at best, they're just trying to steal identities,\" DeMarinis said. \"But at worst, they're there to kind of sow distrust in an election administration and undermine confidence in the system.\" \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Both were ordered to remain held without bond following bail reviews Monday afternoon.With assistance from the Cambridge Police Department, detectives from the Easton Police Department arrested Kevron Chase, 34, ofCambridge and Chadnee Harris, 32, ofHurlock on Saturday.Chase is charged with first-and second-degree murder, first-and second-degree assault, reckless endangerment, using a firearm in a felony crime and illegal possession of a regulated firearm.Harris is charged with acting as an accessory after the fact offirst-and second-degree murder and acting as an accessory after a felony.The charges against the two stemmed from the early morning shooting at the Sidetracked Saloon. Police responded to the bar just before 2 a.m. Saturday morning for a report of shots fired.Officers found a large crowd in the parking lot and a man, later identified as Antonio L. Smith, suffering from a gunshot wound to the head.Two shell casings were found in the parking lot, according to charging documents.Officers initiated lifesaving efforts until Talbot County paramedics arrived and transported Smith to the University ofMaryland Shore Medical Center at Easton, where he was pronounced dead.In charging documents, police said multiple witnesses were interviewed. Multiple people identified Chase as the shooter.Police reviewed the bar's security camera footage, which showed Chase and Harris entering the bar shortly after midnight and exiting to the parking just before 1 a.m., according to charging documents.Further review of the video footage reportedly showed Chase and Harris standing between two cars near the entrance of the bar and Smith approaching the two.The officer reviewing the footage wrote in charging documents that Chase pulled a handgun from his waistband area and pointed the handgun at Smith. Chase put the handgun back toward his waistband area and then appeared to hand the gun to Harris, police said.Smith and Chase began physically fighting in the parking lot, drawing a crowd.Charging documents said Harris walked toward the two men fighting near Chase and that the crowd quickly dispersed. Smith appeared to duck behind a car and Chase walked toward Smith, pointing a handgun at him.The officer who reviewed the footage wrote in charging documents that they saw a muzzle flash from the gun and Smith collapse in between two cars.Security camera footage captured the license plate number on Chase's car, police said. Police shared information with surrounding law enforcement agencies and obtained location data on Chase, who was found in the car with Harris during a traffic stop on Race Street in Cambridge. Both were detained by police.In interviews with Cambridge police, Chase told officers that the physical fight began over Smith trying to rob him several months before, according to charging documents. Chase told police that Smith's friends shot at him, and he fired a single shot back toward their area, but Chase denied shooting Smith.Talbot District Court Judge Karen Ketterman ordered that Chase and Harris remain held without bond during bail reviews Monday afternoon, citing concerns about public safety.Chase and Harris are scheduled to appear for preliminary hearings in the county district court on Oct. 30. \n \n Caption: NATALIE JONES/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nA 23-year-old man was shot and killed outside the Sidetracked Saloon in Easton on Saturday, Sept. 30. \n\n \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "A Laurel man was arrested on charges of theft, malicious destruction of property and other charges relating to the theft of a vehicle. According to a news release from the Easton Police Department, officers responded to Hertrich Chevrolet GMC on Ocean Gateway the morning of May 30 in response to a report of suspicious activity. Upon arrival, officers noticed a white Chevy Silverado with Virginia plates leave the parking lot, police said.\n\nOfficers stopped the vehicle at U5 Foods on Ocean Gateway and detained 20-year-old Donya Jenkins-Patterson. Police said officers noticed the passenger side window was broken and noticed ammunition and equipment that \"appeared to be law enforcement-related\" in the vehicle. During the investigation, officers learned of a second person \"fleeing\" into the wooded area behind Hertrich Chevrolet GMC, police said.\n\nUpon arrival, officers said they noticed the passenger side window of a parked Dorchester County Sheriff's Office vehicle was broken. Police said these observations made it unclear whether the suspect had obtained a firearm. With assistance from Maryland State Police Aviation Command, the Maryland State Police K9 Unit and the Dorchester County Sheriff's Office K9 Unit, Easton police searched the wooded area, but were unable to locate the second suspect, police said.\n\nA few hours later, officers were dispatched to the 29000 block of Hawkes Hill Road in Easton regarding a stolen 2024 Chevy Traverse, police said. Police believe the second suspect that got away stole that car due to the close proximity of thefts. Police said it is unclear what time the Chevy Travers was stolen, but said it was later located in the Hebron area.\n\nAccording to the news release, further investigation revealed the white Chevy Silverado was stolen May 29 from Baltimore around 11 p.m. Police said that items located in the vehicle linked Jenkins-Patterson to vehicle break-ins in Queen Anne's County.",

Ben Cardin expressing \u201cprofound admiration for the unwavering service and sacrifices of our veterans.\u201d\n\nAfter a short video showing a veteran who serves as a court-appointed special advocate, Horne explained, \u201cAt CASA, we really want to honor and recognize our veterans because veterans are people who protect our freedoms, just like our advocates are the people who protect the rights of the children we serve.\u201d She noted her late father, Army veteran and Talbot County Circuit Court Judge William S. Horne, helped bring CASA to the Eastern Shore in 1990.\n\nDenton Town Councilman and former Marine Keith Johnson, who is also president of CASA of Caroline, urged veterans to become volunteers. \u201cDiscipline, fighting spirit, leadership, resiliency. We see our veterans as difference-makers in the world. They\u2019re mission-ready,\u201d Johnson said, adding, \u201cBeing married to an advocate, I know that those traits overlap.\u201d He emphasized the county\u2019s need: \u201cOur children are underserved and our children live as victims of abuse and victims of neglect every day.\u201d Johnson concluded, \u201cIf you\u2019re not an advocate, think about what you can do different this year. The military focuses on protecting our country, while at CASA we want to protect tomorrow\u2019s future \u2014 our children.\u201d",

    "content": "A Cecil County Circuit Court jury acquitted Lacey N. Siple, 31, on Thursday of attempted second-degree murder, first-degree assault and all other charges stemming from an August 30 knife fight on Cedar Hill Circle near North East. Jurors deliberated about two hours after a three-day trial presided over by Judge William W. Davis Jr.; Assistant State\u2019s Attorney Ellis Rollins prosecuted while Assistant Public Defender Denise Winston represented Siple.\n\nTestimony showed weeks of neighborhood tension over one of Siple\u2019s children shooting other kids with a toy gel-ball gun. At roughly 9:30 p.m., an argument between Siple and two women turned physical. Both women, called by the state, admitted they \u201cmaced Siple during the altercation \u2014 but qualified that they did so after she became aggressive, lunging at them.\u201d One said Siple \u201cstabbed her near the shoulder, causing blood to squirt out from the gash, and then stabbed her in the back as she retreated,\u201d leaving her with four stab wounds; the other sustained arm and hand wounds severe enough that \u201cfirst responders applied a tourniquet.\u201d\n\nSiple testified she and a friend were \u201cwalking to Siple\u2019s home to pick up pizza that Siple had forgotten\u201d when \u201ca mob\u2026descended upon them\u2026 and threatened them.\u201d She said moments earlier \u201cfour masked men got out of a vehicle and ran toward her children\u2026 making threats,\u201d so she was already terrified. \u201cA man punched her in the face, as the mob behind him started closing in. \u2018I thought I was going to die. I thought they would stomp me,\u2019 Siple testified.\u201d After being pepper-sprayed she \u201cgrabbed her knife and started flailing her arms blindly. \u2018I was just trying to get home, trying to get home with my kids. I didn\u2019t mean to hurt anybody,\u2019\u201d she sobbed, adding she never realized she had stabbed anyone.\n\nCross-examined on why she never called police, Siple said, \u201cif she were viewed as a \u2018snitch\u2019 in that neighborhood it would put her life and the lives of her four children in jeopardy,\u201d and \u201csomeone simply would snatch\u201d her phone.\n\nIn closing Rollins insisted, \u201cThere was no mob,\u201d labeling Siple \u201cthe initial aggressor\u201d who \u201cbrought a knife to a fistfight. She didn\u2019t just slash the victims; she stabbed them.\u201d\n\nWinston countered: \u201cMy client acted in self-defense\u2026 Every time there was an interaction, it happened outside of her house. They went to her; she didn\u2019t come to them\u2026 They brought the fight to her. She just wanted to go home.\u201d",

The 13-count complaint cites due-process and 14th Amendment violations, civil conspiracy and defamation, and names as defendants Baker, Chief Deputy Rodney Helmer, then-commissioners John Hurley, John Buckle and Anthony Casey, former officer James Joles, the State of Maryland and the town. Plaintiffs, led by former chief Jeff Eckrich, seek back wages, benefits and a court order reinstating the department and its employees.\n\nThe department was suspended with pay in March 2024 while the Office of the State Prosecutor investigated; in April the town laid off all officers and staff effective July 1, 2024. A July 2024 state prosecutor report that investigated only Eckrich for \u201csuspected\u201d perjury and misconduct found \u201cno sufficient evidence\u201d and closed the case. The lawsuit contends the probe stemmed from Joles, who blamed Eckrich for his threatened termination in January 2024 and, after resigning, met with Baker and \u201cthe two devised a plan that would eliminate the RPD and allow Sheriff's Office to assume responsibility for law enforcement in the Town of Ridgely.\u201d The town has contracted with the Caroline County Sheriff\u2019s Office since, budgeting $493,000 for three dedicated officers in fiscal 2026. Baker declined to comment on the lawsuit, citing legal advice, and town attorney Patrick Thomas wrote that he can\u2019t \u201ccomment on pending litigation involving\u201d clients.",

Sellman entered a guilty plea in Queen Anne's County District Court on Nov. 24, 2024, for failing to provide proper shelter for a Cane Corso dog, violating Maryland Criminal Law Article 10-604, Richardson said. The offense is punishable by up to 90 days in jail and/or a $1,000 fine.\n\nIn August 2024, county animal control officers responded to an anonymous tip about a dog in distress at Sellman's Thompson Avenue residence, Richardson reported. Officers found the Cane Corso tethered with a choker collar in direct sunlight without shelter or water. The dog was heavily panting in critical condition, with an external temperature of 121 degrees when the air temperature was 96 degrees. According to Richardson, officers transported the animal to a nearby clinic where it was pronounced dead upon arrival.\n\nRichardson said Sellman received a suspended jail sentence and supervised probation, as he was already incarcerated on unrelated charges. His probation conditions prohibit him from owning or possessing animals and require a mental health evaluation. The Queen Anne's County Animal Abuse Registry, maintained by the county State's Attorney as mandated by County Ordinance 24-17, lists individuals convicted of animal abuse in county courts, Richardson noted.",

My white collar crime unit will continue to hold contractors who breach that trust accountable.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the prison term, Bowen must pay approximately $270,000 in restitution, serve a year of home confinement after release, and is barred from working in home improvement for 4\u00bd years.",

A reception followed at the Sheriff\u2019s Office on Double Hills Road in Denton. About 40 guests\u2014including county commissioners, retired Sheriff Randy Bounds, Judge Heather Price, and Helmer\u2019s family\u2014gave him a standing ovation.\n\n\u201cR.J. has been with me through thick and thin at the sheriff\u2019s office,\u201d Sheriff Donnie Baker said. \u201cHe is true blue, and I really appreciate that, so it wasn\u2019t really a hard choice for me.\u201d Helmer thanked his predecessors: \u201cI thank Sheriff Baker for the opportunity, and I wouldn\u2019t have this opportunity if it weren\u2019t for Sheriff Bounds. It\u2019s a pleasure to work with each and every one of you, and I look forward to doing everything to the best of my ability.\u201d\n\nBounds praised the new chief deputy: \u201cR.J. is an outstanding police officer, a wonderful human being and one of the hardest working people that I\u2019ve ever had the pleasure of working with. It was an honor to hire him, and I\u2019ve never regretted that one second. He\u2019s knowledgeable, energetic, and most supremely of all, he cares about those with whom he interacts. You will never, ever have to worry about his dedication and loyalty. He will serve the citizens of Caroline County well.\u201d\n\nBaker added, \u201cHe is an absolutely hardworking individual and a very capable individual to be my chief deputy and to lead this agency to the next level.\u201d\n\nHelmer began his law-enforcement career with the Cambridge Police Department in July 2008 and joined the Sheriff\u2019s Office as a deputy first class on Aug. 19, 2013. He lives in Hurlock, where he served as chief of the Hurlock Volunteer Fire Company until Dec. 18. He formerly led the criminal investigation division as lieutenant; Lt. George Paugh, ex-chief of the Greensboro Police Department, was appointed to that post Nov. 1. Helmer succeeds Maj. James Henning, who retired in September after more than 26 years with the agency.",

    "author": "WILL BONTRAGER wbontrager@chespub.com",
    "content": "Chestertown criminal-defense and immigration attorney Ivette Furneisen says federal enforcement on Maryland\u2019s Eastern Shore has intensified under the Trump administration. \u201cIn general, I see that people are being picked up and detained for minor traffic offenses,\u201d she said, contrasting today\u2019s practice with past ones in which \u201cfelonies and misdemeanors such as assault, theft, neglect of a minor and sex crimes would lead to deportation since they are crimes of moral turpitude. Under Trump however, people are being picked up for minor offenses and then targeted by ICE.\u201d\n\nFurneisen described a recent case in which a client acquitted of DUI after open containers were found in his car was later stopped by ICE agents while driving his pregnant wife home from a medical appointment. \u201cAgents busted out the windows while his pregnant wife was in the car and detained him,\u201d she said, adding that she and the man\u2019s family did not know where he was for three days. She also reported undercover ICE agents arresting another client inside a courthouse: \u201cI am seeing a lot of failure to appear in court, especially for minor traffic violations, and that makes things worse for those facing charges. I tell them they need to show up for court with a lawyer.\u201d\n\nThe Spain-born naturalized U.S. citizen, who earned her law degree at the University of Barcelona and a U.S. law master\u2019s from George Mason, is half of Campbell and Furneisen on Cross Street in Chestertown and one of the only Spanish-speaking lawyers on the Shore. She said her docket is overflowing: \u201cI am swamped with work of this nature,\u201d citing cases in Kent, Talbot and Queen Anne\u2019s counties. She noted that many undocumented clients \u201cpay taxes and they are contributing, but they are still getting deported.\u201d\n\nFurneisen criticized new federal efforts to curtail bond hearings, warning, \u201cThe problem is that this will lead to indefinite detention because there is a backlog in immigration court. These people could be detained for years before they have their immigration hearing.\u201d She recalled one client who, after refusing to plead guilty to theft and paying restitution, was released by a judge but then given a choice by ICE: \u201cget deported or sign a voluntary departure. He chose the latter and went back to an area where his brothers and cousins were tortured before being beheaded by a gang.\u201d She added, \u201cThat\u2019s why I fight so hard to keep them here, but sometimes everything goes against you and you lose those battles.\u201d\n\nKent County Sheriff Dennis Hickman said his office\u2019s policy remains unchanged: \u201cIn the past ICE has placed a detainer on illegal immigrants who were being held on local charges, but when the sentence was over they were required to come get them. That practice has not changed.\u201d Furneisen, encouraged by high-profile reversals such as that of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, maintains, \u201cJust because you\u2019re being charged with a crime doesn\u2019t mean you did it. I love my job in helping those who don\u2019t have a voice and being an advocate for them.\u201d",

Dorchester County State's Attorney Amanda Leonard confirmed the eight new counts stem from the same 2024 incidents with a woman that led to the now-dropped charges.\n\nAccording to court documents, Rodriguez is accused of demanding a then-18-year-old woman produce photos and videos sexual in nature on four separate occasions between March 16 and April 1, 2024. Cambridge Police Department investigators obtained message logs between Rodriguez and the woman, and police allege in court records that Rodriguez threatened to have the woman \"physically assaulted by other parties for her failure to comply with his demands.\" In two instances, the woman did \"acquiesce to the demands,\" police wrote. Investigators said social media messages reveal \"her declining mental state and depression,\" and court records state the threats \"inflicted emotional distress.\"\n\nRodriguez was released on his own recognizance on Aug. 19, and a hearing in district court is scheduled for Sept. 29.",
